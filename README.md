#####HW1: Hello Alexa
* lambda.py: A python interface to build intent handlers and responses for Alexa. Modified from the Alexa Skill Set tutorial to say hello and a CS pickup line. 


* intent_schema.json and sample_utterances: The sample utterances file has the name of the intent on the first column followed by a possible utterance/words/sentences that the user might say to Alexa to trigger that intent. 



#####HW2: Tensorflow Tutorials
* xor.py: Training a XOR model on Tensorflow. Ran experiments where I modified the activation functions and loss functions on this implemention of https://github.com/StephenOman/TensorFlowExamples/blob/master/xor%20nn/xor_nn.py 

* translate.py: A seq2seq model to translate from English to French
