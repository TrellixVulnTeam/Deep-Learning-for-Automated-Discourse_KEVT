half the house youll never see a penny i want it here in my hand
who was that
whats that oh  who gave you this how much is it wolfi who gave you this
excellency
frau mozart
some service deserves service in return no
this is not his handwriting
oh now im a bad housekeeper
hey
do you know who i am  this is my daughter i am frau weber we are favoured guests
perhaps a little refreshment first a little coffee or a little chocolate
i was but she quite outgrew the little i could show her
what a charming idea may i see
delightful court composer would you permit me to play it as he comes in
my pleasure
oh your majesty it would be such a tremendous honour
i dont think you understand me court composer
why not
oh thank you
why so
so then you like it you really like it your majesty
what do you mean sire
majesty this is madame weber she is my landlady
bravo mozart most charming yes indeed clever man
do you always live like this
oh we could if we wanted to but stanzi wont hear of it she wants to do everything herself
what do you mean its wonderful really its  its marvelous people love me here
yes
isnt that marvelous were delighted
no really
im tired of this game please play without me
ah here she comes fraulein lorl good morning
ahha siena macaroons  my favourites give my best thanks to the baker
isnt he marvelous he cost me a bundle that horse but hes worth it i tell you if youd played don giovanni here it would have been a great success im not joking these people arent fools you could do something marvelous for them
im serious you write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs ill guarantee youll have a triumph deluxe mind you itll have to be in german
good morning fraulein schlumberg
its a miracle herr mozart
well this is hardly the way to go about it
i know your work well signore do you know i actually composed some variations on a melody of yours
mio caro adone
why didnt you come to me yesterday mozart this is a most painful situation yesterday i could have helped you today i cant
my dear mozart there is no one in the world i would rather help but now it is too late
how can anyone say that we have no cook no maid we have no footman nothing at all
theyre stupendously successful you cant get a seat the only problem is none will hire me they all want to hear me play but they wont let me teach their daughters as if i was some kind of fiend im not a fiend
do you have a daughter
id better not its a bit of a secret
i cant say really
with all my heart mozart
what did you think of it yourself did you like it at all
its the best opera yet written i know it why didnt they come
mozart it was good of you to come
yes
i dont have it yet its not finished im sorry but i need more time
i do
are you ill
wait ask him if hed give me some money now tell him if he would that would help me finish it
you know its all here in my head its just ready to be set down but when im dizzy like this my eyes wont focus i cant write
where did i stop
so now the confutatis confutatis maledictis when the wicked are confounded flammis acribus addictis how would you translate that
the fire
good now the tenors fourth beat of the first measure  c  confutatis  second measure fourth beat on d  maledictis  all right
with the tenors
oh have i seen it
then why especially does it have to be in german
that will do herr mozart
mozart herr mozart may i have a word with you please right away
did you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas
exactly a dance
why do i have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee just to teach a sixteenyearold girl
no but im the best
herr mozart 
about what
oh i know that thats charming  i didnt know you wrote that
of course the man you accuse yourself of killing
it was incomprehensible what was god up to here i was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve gods gift and there was mozart indulging his in all directions  even though engaged to be married  and no rebuke at all was it possible i was being tested was god expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense no matter how painful that was very possible all the same why him why use mozart to teach me lessons in humility my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts i couldnt stop them
all i ever wanted was to sing to him thats his doing isnt it he gave me that longing  then made me mute why tell me that if he didnt want me to serve him with music why implant the desire like a lust in my body then deny me the talent go on tell me speak for him
my son why should you want all vienna to believe you a murderer is that your penance is it
mozart is writing a new opera an italian opera
ballet what ballet
bravo your majesty
i know we banned this play but frankly i cant remember why can you refresh my memory herr director
that lady is back sir

how can this be  you and me at the same time the exact same thought its scary
cant you just quit  walk away
you okay
why did you even come up with that shit if you didnt want it made
youve said that already
whos side are you on
thanks
how long have you and hambone been hangin out
that crazy brother of yours doesnt think so
dunwitty and i feel youve been getting too close to him getting his mind all messed up
this thing was rigged the deck was stacked the fix was in  could don king be near  good thing sloan had my back  shes my rock  this was going to be a whole lot of work
im happy for all of us  its just we have a great responsibility now the pressure is on
thats the way it came out  let me ask you one question  have you ever been in want in need your entire privileged life
this is nothing  it will blow over by tomorrow
no joke  serious
you getting scared because some people dont like what you are doing
you hear me talkin to you  the only time you come up here when something is wrong
mommy please dont call me that
please let me know when you hear from daddy get a number or something
a fiasco  a disaster  a boondoggle an abomination
ahhh  i never heard of that term before  i thought you were black of africanamerican  no
good luck jukka  do a good show
you sing and dance
if that was suppose to be a compliment i thank you
why do you say that  youve never seen me
this is my best friend sleep n eat
mantan way too short too tight get her one of dose
aconite get it dat cheap
oh because on our first date she let me
yes she did
then what about
like macaroni and cheese
i fell out of my bed last night
a lot
the good stuff
this is a nice place  it must have cost a pretty penny
yknow at the beginnin of the century africanamerican had to perform in blackface  you ever heard of bert williams  he was a great artist
you dont read do you
why dont you call him
youre sure this is a good idea
you leave something out
and
aw cmon
so you say  sloan you wuz gonna use me up just like you used dela work it to the top  i never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like ihop  im damn happy dela fired ya ass
i know i wont be your puppet
theres nothing else for it  take your ground grogan  twelve paces i suppose
hoitytoity  john best whats the matter here
what are the chevaliers intentions
ill match any man with the sword
youre an impostor young man a schemer a deceiver
chevalier though i cannot say how i believe you have cheated me
it is shameful  infamous  i insist upon being put down at the austrian ambassadors house
you are the young man who m de seebach recommended
for whom else have you worked
but they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost
i believe they will deport you
it is distasteful to kill a scoundrel  that should be work for a hangman
perfectly so and what is more i will tell you that i love her and that i am not of a humor to put up with rivals
not even that
your word empty makes me laugh is it fortunate or unfortunate  if it is fortunate i congratulate myself  if it is unfortunate i do not care for i am not aware of it
you will do as you please  it seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other  do you not agree
will we always leave it at this
shall i tell you something  i believed what was called love came after the union  and i was surprised when my husband making me a woman made me know it only by pain unaccompanied by any pleasure i saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead  and so we became only friends seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other yet on good terms for a while as whenever he wanted me i was at his service but since the offering was not seasoned with love he found it tasteless and seldom demanded it
i hate miss clancy you know i do and i only danced with her because  because  the person with whom i intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night
were you obliged to dance five times with captain best and then stroll out with him into the garden
what with me on the pillion  would you kill poor me
all the same you must name an amount
how different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at kilwangan assemblies  in every sentence she mentioned a lord or a person of quality  to the ladys question about my birth and parentage i replied that i was a young gentleman of large fortune that i was going to dublin for my studies and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum
there are a few other points we should discuss  the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyships signature and provided that bracegirdle and chatwick can be assured of her ladyships freewill in giving her signature
sir let those laugh that win
charming schuvaloff
dark valdez

to know about it  it was a kill squad black on black closed down two years ago nobody wants to know about treadstone not around here  you better take this back to marty and make sure he knows what youre doing
so whats he doing you believe him
there were two charges they were supposed to go off simultaneously the second one the one that didnt go off was down here  first of all this is nothing its a subline for the breaker above second why put the charge all the way down here if youre good enough to get in here and handle the gear youre good enough to know you dont need this  bourne would know
is it a slam dunk no but
no its because you dont know how they died
it was my job my first time your father was supposed to be alone but then your mother she came out of nowhere  i had to change my plan  you understand me  you dont have to live like that anymore thinking that
you know im not
i should kill you if its true you should die i should kill you now
i emptied it
try again
youre sure  we should still  we should write it down
its just a nightmare
so
thats crazy
 wheres left to go 
you drive
jesus    is he back there 
im going to bail on the other side and wait this bridge is the only way he can follow
if he crosses the bridge it is
i wanted to kill him
i know its a dream
you left a print there was kel that didnt go off there was a partial print they tracked it back to treadstone they know its you
thats a lie
no jason please
its me
where am i
dont need it i remember everything
 so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines one of them failed the fingerprint  thats from the one that didnt go off
alright take it down
its a lot of money pam
still
i want that area secured i want any evidence secured and i want it done now is that clear
i dont think we need to keep looking for him anyway
yes in that order
but what will you do
with cavalry  not heavy like the english but light fast horsemen like you nobles employ  we could outmaneuver their bowmen
does anyone know his politics
the crown is that of scotland and scotland is william wallace
scottish rebels have routed lord bottoms
so i did and what was so important about it
shut up would you how can i concentrate
rest william

i see
i want you to take miss lund home
excuse me monsieur rick but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs the cashier would like some money
here you are
the bourbon  the news about ugarte upset me very much
of course not what upsets me is the fact that ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are
if i could lay my hands on those letters i could make a fortune
naturally there will be a few incidental expenses that is the proposition i have for whoever has those letters
rick ill put my cards on the table i think you know where those letters are
thats why i came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place
i observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man monsieur i am moved to make one more suggestion why i do not know because it cannot possibly profit me but have you heard about signor ugarte and the letters of transit
do you know where they are
there are only two other alternatives for him
im willing to be overcharged tell me
my germans a little rusty
but be serious darling you are in danger and you must leave paris
please
how did you get in
i told you this morning youd come around but this is a little ahead of schedule well wont you sit down
do i have to hear again what a great man your husband is what an important cause hes fighting for
richard richard we loved each other once if those days meant anything at all to you 
put them on the table
i cant fight it anymore i ran away from you once i cant do it again oh i dont know whats right any longer youll have to think for both of us for all of us
i dont understand what about you
maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life
yes
hello sam
play it sam play as time goes by
dont joke after major strassers warning tonight i am frightened
ask me
no victor there isnt
be careful
captain the boy who is playing the piano somewhere i have seen him
yes
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca
and i congratulate you
your work
i hope we didnt overstay our welcome
monsieur blaine i wonder if i could talk to you
my friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record you ran guns to ethiopia you fought against the fascists in spain
are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs
ill raise it to two hundred thousand
there must be some reason why you wont let me have them
my bill
well a precedent is being broken er emil
and the honor of having served the third reich
i believe you have a message for him
even in berlin
you will give us the names
oh there is no hurry tonight hell be at ricks everybody comes to ricks
thank you it is a pleasure to have you here major
may i recommend veuve cliquot 26 a good french wine
rick this is major heinrich strasser of the third reich
you repeat third reich as though you expected there to be others
mademoiselle
you see what i mean if laszlos presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration what more will his presence in casablanca bring on i advise that this place be shut up at once
it was a combination of all three
if you are thinking of warning him dont put yourself out he cannot possibly escape
you know rick we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the blue parrot but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here it will amuse your customers
i see and whats strasser doing here he certainly didnt come all the way to casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency
it doesnt matter there is no exit visa for him
the winning side would have paid you much better
i have my orders
well you were asking about rick and here he is mademoiselle may i present 
well ricky im very pleased with you now youre beginning to live like a frenchman
serves me right for asking a direct question the subject is closed
well theyre all excellent reasons
youre late
 not so fast louis nobodys going to be arrested not for a while yet
what you just did for laszlo and that fairy tale that you invented to send ilsa away with him i know a little about women my friend she went but she knew you were lying
i suppose you know this isnt going to be pleasant for either of us especially for you ill have to arrest you of course
it might be a good idea for you to disappear from casablanca for a while theres a free french garrison over at brazzaville i could be induced to arrange a passage
uh huh
where were you last night
make it official if you like
i understand you came here from paris at the time of the occupation
are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans in their beloved paris
my interest in whether victor laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one
not particularly i understand the point of view of the hound too
huh you know rick watching you just now with the deutsches bank one would think youd been doing this all your life
thank you  will you have a drink with me please
well rick after tonight ill be through with the whole business and i am leaving finally this casablanca
rick rick help me
aint you planning on going to bed in the near future
no not me boss
well stop it you know what i want to hear

the food and drug administration said wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters burns and rashes although the fda judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings

time to play spam in the can
captain miller were ready to repressurize the clark
damn dr weir dont scare us like that coffee
coffee
the event horizon only had life support for eighteen months it seems impossible but in light of the transmission i have to think that someone has managed to endure until now
what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion
can you shut it down
i i tried to go back for him to save him but i couldnt get to him in time the fire have you ever seen fire in zerogravity its like a liquid it slides over everything it was like a wave breaking over him a wave of fire and then he was gone  i never told anyone until now but this ship knew dj it knows about the goliath it knows about corrick it knows our secrets it knows what were afraid of  and now youre going to tell me its carbon dioxide
what is it
please kill
intubate pure oxygen feed get the nitrogen out of his blood
you wanted to see me admiral
that ship was lost in deep space seven years ago if the titanic sailed into new york harbor id find it more plausible  houston wants aerospace to send out a search and rescue team investigate the source of the transmission if it really is the event horizon theyll attempt a salvage  we need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ships systems for the salvage crew
its against my better judgement but ill run this by the man downstairs youll know my decision by the end of the day
youre not seriously considering sending him
he doesnt belong on this mission responsible or not he blames himself hes too close to it  and then theres his wife
what does
its inside and it eats and eats until theres nothing left
but i cant i gotta get out of here skipper please
this is weir
whats the hold up
that means they didnt abandon ship
okay im on the bridge
everythings been shut down conserving power i guess green light on the hull its intact
justin check the containment for radiation leaks peters
can anybody hear me
peters we need to know what happened to the crew before it happens to us
captain miller i appreciate this opportunity
its 2041
were a long way from home and were in a bad place lets not make it worse if anyone has any constructive suggestions now is the time
i want to know what caused that noise i want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock
what about my ship
you cant leave she wont let you
your eyes
what are you
then what what are you tell me
1500 meters were getting too close
do we have enough time for a weld
were losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked in three minutes our atmosphere will be gone we are fucking dead
captain miller you copy
thank you
were past the outer marker we can engage the ion drive whenever youre ready
starck why arent you on the bridge
crossing the horizon optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees
everybody okay
the event horizon sensors show the same thing bioreadings of indeterminate origin right before that wave hit the clark there was some kind of surge right off the scale but now its back to its previous levels
who
i didnt say that i said the bio readings correspond to what happened to you the ship is reacting to us
its not bullshit its the only conclusion the data supports
dr weir whats this the door to
can you see a body
about an hour ago in medical i saw my son he was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were 
jesus that is one big ugly fat fucker
the scope is lit its right in front of us
what if the air has gone bad we cant wear these suits forever
a straight line
the reactors still hot weve got several small radiation sources leaks probably nothing serious
could it be the crew if they were in suspended animation wouldnt that effect the scan
what is it
thats how the gravity drive works you see it focuses the black holes immense gravitational power to create the gateway thats how the event horizon travels faster than light
in our current environment dr weir selfcontrol is an asset
such a sad face you know sometimes being different isnt a bad thing
you dont know what its like out there walking around like some kind of circus freak people staring whispering 
i mean
way to not overthink it  so when do we leave
we can monitor the clouds approach and observe the tests from here
you look like an eighties rock band
just give reed a little more time you know how he works  analyzing every little step before he takes one 
about me how sweet

reeds disaster you know i half think he did this to me on purpose

as far as crew i was hoping ben could pilot the mission 
for science
its not invisibility per se youre bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field thats what you projected on the bridge
okay is there any way to duplicate that feeling some memory or
im sorry im sorry i didnt mean to do that you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or 
what are you doing
but were the focus right reed reed
dont let victor push you into making a mistake 
i could get ben to tap into the baxters main power to generate enough voltage 
you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you speak his mind one who wasnt afraid to tell you what he wanted
but dreams dont pay the bills do they  same old reed the hopeless optimist still reaching for the stars with the world on your back
ben did this
im starting to wonder the same thing how much do you know about what happened to you

faster tommy get us out of here
the throat the mouth its vulnerable spots
continue forward sir
well now theres something worth dying for  what do you think
unfortunately ill never get the chance  im leaving in an hour for congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion  wasting my time naturally look at her teasing those bumpkins
damnit  youve given us a whole new season benedict  and congress thinks that the british are going to ride right over us come spring now half their army is back in canada
they dont trust me thats the truth isnt it  sam adams never did
were in bad shape benedict moral is low  before i can do anything i need lee and his seven thousand troops  ive ordered him to join us three times  in my last letter i all but begged him to come here the man is insubordinate
have you heard  the british are negotiating to make a trade for general lee
they love reed and his inquisition i think they hope to share in his disgusting profits  its becoming the american way
what  what are you talking about
wil
wil im giving you your freedom do you understand
by red what rank would you say this black officer soldier is colonel
what the goddamned hell do you think you are doing
i was a clerks apprentice on saint croix  but then i went to kings college
general greene is here  there are two other divisions here
sir arnold is a traitor
george remember that night when we were drinking with arnold
he warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people  even if it was against congress  george the time has come for you to declare yourself king of america  listen to me the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne  george you must declare yourself with us or against us
have you decided if you are going to join the virginia delegation to the constitutional convention
who the hell knows  everyones giving orders  its all very democratic
colonel charles lee hounds and all  quite the character  hes got a tremendous reputation
they are friends of congress
lets not over do it
if we have any hope for a compromise or truce with england now we have to hold on here  our men must believe they can win  the british must believe that somehow in some mad impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them
colonel reed
george im afraid if you go through with this madness i must tender my resignation as your aide i see where were headed youre putting your trust in the likes of hamilton and arnold
and hamilton  greene
arnold is indispensable do you understand  i need arnold to help me win this war
however through my relations with members of his majestys court i am a representative of the french government whose deepest desire is to be one people united with our american brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of king george of england  vive la france  vive lamerique
gentlemen my i introduce a french gentleman recently appointed major general by congress  marie joseph paul yves roch gilbert du motier marquis de lafayette general lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen and how many cases of muskets mon petite marquis
charming little victories please dont expect much more of us monsieur
these supplies
what is it marquis
its another demonstration against the king  this is the wildest yet
of course if it were that simple  these people  theyre after something else
liberty virtue country thats from cato you know that play about the noble romans  as i was riding up to philadelphia i found myself thinking about the old days
its an antichristian dogma  i cannot believe you are so calm about it
not today
theyre finished they cant help us anymore  theyve done their duty general greene now you do yours
the only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them fifty lashes each
nathanael someone bred to station bred to being a gentleman  unlike these men  his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs
sir i have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform
and what is this then  been off to fight the french because you are a patriot  or is this you gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war
you remember george when we were studying the great philosophers
well i remember a philosopher who said something that i used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements but which i now see means us all
where do those men come from george
cranes  who needs to walk like a crane
i dont laugh at you george  i like you  i like you because you will never ever make it as an aristocrat and thats because youre completely incompetent at hiding your feelings
ive been surprised in an unguarded hour but must not now go back the love that lay half smothered in my breast has broke through all its weak restraints and burns in its full lustre  i cannot if i would conceal it from thee

i think that phillip and enid can help us to see that there aremany different ways we can express ourselves  we can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues emotional spiritual political of great importance i hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class  who is responsible for this

well because im curious  i want to know more about what you do here  frankly there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation for instance the storage of noxious possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement  now either you show me whats down there or i come back with a court order
have it your way mr venkman
at ease officers  im peter venkman  i think theres been some kind of misunderstanding here and i want to cooperate in every way i can

its here ray  its looking at me
agile bastard isnt he

whats he talking about  choose what
where are we now commodus  can you see the camp  my gods  the air is turning into ice

so am i
marcus aurelius has died
tribuus what happened in the arena was narcissus killed
the emperor and i are bound by the threads of the fates  he was born on august thirtyfirst you know
its time for you to tell the citizens that commodus stole the money allocated for defending the german border  its time to tell the citizens everything  will you write it
i believe we are arriving in an enlightened age an age of peace that will bring rome her greatest glory  thanks to marcus aurelius
the senate too
would you support the senate if they would give you a trial  youd have to give me your word
no futuretelling please ive been terrified enough for one day
you know our two most senior senators  gaius cantus and falco verus
i want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign
its not because hes young its because hes ignorant and arrogant his sister is a better man  thats why i have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the senate
why dont we try to keep politics out of the conversation
on his death bed i promised marcus i would complete our work here  the senate may be vacillating but i have the army behind me  im taking half a cohort and restocking that fort
what about their philosophy lessons
im a soldier  were at war  i cant stay home tending the damned olive groves
me  well i believe in rome youd have to after what ive seen how people outside the empire treat each other
sorry but i have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise i wont even get back the cost of the bribe i had to pay the arena slaves to get you here  i know what youre trying to do  kill yourself and trust in the roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands  the only thing you have accomplishes is to prove youre a very important individual  you make me feel good about my investment  and that puking pig jerses  he wont even discuss you  both of you have clamped mouths  but i love all my fighters  ill find out about your family  and about you  that i promise
at the end of the day i was approached by the golden pompeii olive oil company  small but profitable  they asked if you would endorse their oil  we could get some very nice posters  make some very big money
general hang on drink slowly you are blessed by the gods to have a physician and a divine of janus with you tonight  a fan sent them to you

such nobility from such an ignoble mouth  take my advice and make that bet

yes
im sorry but do i know you 
a bitch
weve never met
you know what gets me
you were rich before  this is the first time i was ever rich
im liable to find anything
you know what gets me  those guys who went to the moon  to the moon boy
and how were things
otherwise how are things
i guess  youre lucky you dont have any old people around here
you told me
fourteen times you told me  i counted
alice would be absolutely tearass
all the more reason to go to africa
is penelope in
i cant get over how you guys are my friends  harold ryan and looseleaf harper are my friends
eight years you guys were together through thick and thin
you invited me
what went wrong
no matter what you say to me i still think youre the greatest guy i ever knew
youyou arent going to have any friends left if you dont watch out
hello
ask it
the doctor was called away on an emergency  i think it was birth
you think you could find me a pencil and paper
and youve been roaming the streets while your mother is godknowswhere
what a pity  educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine swiss watch  everything stops  and the doctor  he worships your father too
excellent
as in death where is thy sting he killed at least fifty men wounded hundreds more
ask about the time he and i were parachuted into yugoslavia to join a guerrilla bandin the war against the nazis
hid by dayfought by night  at sunset one day your father and i peering through field glasses saw a black mercedes draw up to a village inn  it was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car  out of the mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of historythe beast of yugoslavia
its rather a disappointment these days  it isnt there any more
the germans shot everybody who lived there then leveled it plowed it planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground they wished revenge for the slaying of the beast of yugoslavia  to their twisted way of thinking your father had butchered an eagle scout  play lots of contact sports
does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that
youre a very good boy to respond that way
wants to fix up her makeup no doubt
yes sir  if you cant wake mom up ive got doubledecker bunks
a hundred dollars for breakfast
what kind of exercise
whats this
get mad  tell me you dont like the way i treat your mother  tell me you wish id never come home
im sorry sir im engaged to be married  my boyfriend would be mad if i went out with another man
some kind of animal
disease
bluh
whats that all about
when im dead  or fucking
you know what i want  i want you both to be friends  i know you both respect you both you should be friends
im so glad you like each other  i was so scared so scared
please
he doesnt deserve this  you dont know him  it isnt fair
youll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again  you used to eat it up
you used to like it stark
i have some change
which one
shes up in heaven now  she didnt hear  she is experiencing nothing but pure happiness  theres nothing nicer than that  chow  harold ryan wants chow
thats what youre supposed to say
fish cant feel
you learned this in some college course
and he keeps it in his apartment
thats too bad  i would rather have him at hometo see what im going to do
did you like it dear
unless she has nerve
he knows you shattered his violin
things
goodbye goodbye goodbye
testimonials of that sort areare beyond my range  i dont do them well  thats a failing i know
see how youve upset him  he was so merry and hale before you came home
what kind of a country has this become  the men wear beads and refuse to fightand the woman adore them  americas days of greatness are over  it has drunk the blue soup
youre begging him to kill you
no you dont
but its all balled up in your head with death  the highest honor is death  when you talk of these animals one by one you dont just talk of killing them  you honored them with death  haroldit is not honor to be killed
im going to call the police
i mean it
give me that goddamn thing  now get out of here or i might kill you  who knows
norbertyou come too  let him go harold  let him go
lookthis isnt my apartment and there isnt anybody else here  mrs ryan wont be home for a while
ah  youre ambulatory
well nowwhat seems to be the trouble with the patient today  a touch of malaria perhaps
youve been bitten by bats
you have chills
you can also describe its cure im eating its cure
congratulations  by crossing twentyeight feet of cockroach infested carpet youve become the third white man ever to hear of it
good lord
i thought she was a widow
theres a certain amount of information there
this is man to man
something seems to have happened to my selfrespect
can i beg for mercyon my knees
jesusi dunno  you know  what the heck  who knows
how horrible
and you colonel  let me guess you dont know
so long you guys
mr ryan just borrowed my birthday cake  i dont really know him
im only ten years old
you were harold ryans third wife right
ach soooooooooo mildred no grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation  harold would come home trumpeting and roaring  he would the kick the furniture with his boots spit into corners and the fireplace  he would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them he would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him and hed tear off my clothes  he would carry me into the bedroom telling me to scream and kick my feet  that was very important to him  i did it  i tried to be a good wife  he told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo  i couldnt do that but i pretended i did  it was all overten seconds after hed said the word buffalo then hed zip up his pants and go outside and tell true war stories to the little kids  any little kids
i worship your father  that stuffed alligator your mother gave methe one he shot  its the proudest thing in my apartment
i feel like i want to yell my head offjust yell anything  bullllllllllllllldickey
dont touch me
and this is my son paul  he was only four years old when his father disappeared
oh paul
in a railroad accident many years ago
norbert was just beginning practice a real man would have sold her to a catfood company i suppose  as far as that goes j edgar hoover still lives with his mother
i dont really know
i dont get it
we dont have a maid any more
everything stays as it is
i hate that thing
i keep having this nightmarethat he catches us
yes
i see
is he all right
the park
i figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another
for harold  when paul comes home we can have some birthday cake
weve got to find him  i want you to show me exactly where you saw him last  and you stay here norbert in case he comes home  thats all he saidthe thing about the key
whats the matter now
a week  we were waiting for the right time to
you were wonderful
its true
you and harold are friends
i am dr norbert woodlya physician a healer  i find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society  gentleness must replace violence everywhere or we are doomed
the wilder paul is tonight the calmer hell be tomorrow
id be dead by now if that were the case
if he is in the park luck is all that can save him now and theres plenty of that
no  but hes going to be  if he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side i can say to him you and i are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight  on that we can build
thats been said before
you know each other
im taking her to the airport a few minutes from now  shes going to east st louisto visit an aunt
hi kid  would you look what the car dragged in
we simply stop doing thatdropping things on each other eating each other alive
start with the smallest weights every week add a pound or two
if hed just get into scouting and camp out some and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire

yeah
fantastic but im a little busy right now  listen  do you want to come to dinner saturday  im having some friends over and i need a spare man are you a spare man
its all kind of lost in the in the dense mists of time now it wasnt that i really liked marco more  in fact i thought you were more shall we say attractive than him  it was just that he knew he was goodlooking and you didnt and that made a difference somehow  you used to act as if i was weird for wanting to spend time with you and that got kind of beat if you know what i mean  your selfimage started to rub off on me and i ended up thinking that i was strange  and i knew that you were kind and thoughtful you made me laugh and i dug the way you got consumed by things you loved and marco seemed a bit more i dont know glamorous more sure of himself  less hard work because i felt like i was dragging you around sort of  a little sunnier  sparkier  i dont know  you know what people are like at that age  they make very superficial judgements  do you think thats superficial  he was a clown if its any consolation
morning dick
yeah i havent really absorbed that one
or rather bad news and good news because he likes this person playing tonight  i mean he liked laura too i didnt mean that  and he likes you  its just that 
can i do anything
funnily enough i havent been too thrilled about it
so shall we leave it at that then
 alright alright but 
have you tackled the great reorganization yet
i guess its not that obvious then
did you say something
i dont know
yeah  great
is it better
never
but not even before when he was living upstairs
fine im sure its in the file at home  ill call you when i find it and then well talk
is that why you wanted to see me
oh rob  what do you want me to say
okay okay  i get the picture
hello
guess who i just saw right by my store  ian  in starbucks  neat huh
are you alright
who the fucks pig
look are you coming or not
youre soaking
ive only got a couple left  im saving them for later
so if you had a bit more energy wed stay split  but things being how they are what with you wiped out youd like us to get back together
what about ian
look rob  if great sex was as important as you think it is and if i was having great sex with him then we wouldnt be lying here now and that is my last word on the subject okay
 like mexico  or jamaica  or new york even
how  how were we the same people
but what
hi
oh  well  we dont really get along paul and i
im sorry  but two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for the reader werent you
about what
whats happenin
youre kidding  a crematorium jesus
good  cause im enjoying myself
awhile back dick and barry and i agreed that what really matters is what you like not what you are like
are you okay
for now  but i wouldnt be if i thought this was the end of the evening
great  superfantastic
you know thats not whats upsetting me
i knew this would happen  what are you going to do rob
and after that
but you must have 
look  can i pay you properly  you dont have to tell him what you got send him fortyfive bucks and blow the rest  give it to charity  or something
can i buy this otis redding single off you
jesus  that things been in the bargain bin for six months  was it just your criminal nature or what hell i wouldve given it to you for free
i warned you
youre the expert
that stuffll put you away if youre not careful
i dont know what youre talking about
he called you macleod
i left a man dead in felton  but you dont really care do you
he sees me as a threat
no  i had to talk to you
youre wrong
is this what you killed them with
our cars were seen together in felton  theyre calling me an accessory to murder
whats all that
you did kill those men
when you finish what then
there was a man once  just a simple woodcarver  but he understood  more than anyone he could see to the heart of it  it never ends  today is the same as the first  tomorrow will be the same as today  so much time  and all of it wasted  you love history
no  so what now  we just wait
here try this  i suppose theyre still making women the same as back then
ive been telling myself its the award winning journal article im going to write  but its not  its you
my life has been chock full of people with complications and weak nesses  i cant stand it  but youre different  its in your hands  a clarity
yes
sometimes i think its just for something to do  a conquest to be the last  something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away  some thing to replace the love that can never work
perhaps  there is something more an inheritance
what is it like  being you
but youre known so much history ill only read about
i have witnesses that can put the two of you together
i liked the bit you did about baltic chastity belts too bad no one else did
your back it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle
your marks would suggest great injury
how can you know this
do you ever feel a flow as if some thing were pushing against you
three days youve laid there its time you ate
you are not dead boy  accept it

how can i stop such a man
it will take less effort as you learn

it does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds  but the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening for it gives you great strength  the strength of knowledge  the ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be
you have not been fully trained but you will learn  and you will be good i can feel that  you have apt itude  this is why our friend is so concerned

lowell
i dont know how does that get wigand on the air
did i get you up
i see a rhetorical question on the horizon
mike in my
perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and i see the questions first then i decide if i grant the interview
whos that
but thats as far as i go
it happened after i talked to you i do not like coincidences
you came all the way down here to tell me that
okay
is that why you became a journalist then you get to ask all the questions
why
are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here i never abandoned a source
jeff call the fbi right away
im going to be a witness for them in their litigation so im going to fly to pascagoula to give a deposition
part of the reason im here is i felt that their representation clearly at least within
no no what
yes did you lie about being on the american judo team in the olympics
up to you jeffrey thats the power you have jeffrey vital insider information the american public need to know lowell bergman the hot show who never met a source he couldnt turn around
what about now
hold on a minute lowell  somebody may be following me i dont know they came on the property
i dont want to be paranoid i mean maybe its a game some kind of mind game
well no look i mean there was a footprint forget it its probably not important at all  you know i got a job now im teaching high school japanese and chemistry  so what were you calling about
and so i moved out i see the girls a couple of days a week
now they tried to get the mississippi court to honor it but the judge threw it out  however for you there is a more perilous effect to the kentucky gag order
all of us did there was this whole line of people whole line of ceos up there all swearing
a delivery device for nicotine put it in your mouth light it up and youre gonna get your fix
i sent the document forward to sandefur i was told that we would continue to work on a substitute we werent going to remove it as it would impact sales and that that was his decision
object to the form of the question
my cocounsel ron motley and i have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the state of mississippi to get the state reimbursed medicaid costs for treating people with smokingrelated illness  if youd be interested in talking to us wed certainly like to talk to you
yeah i know leather would be more practical but whatcha gonna do
sixteen years howard jr is fourteen and mandy must be what  twelve
as you are well aware my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation my motives were questioned i was slandered in court
oh right wont you have a seat
and how is mrs reiser
 understand what youre asking for here the massey prenup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in and earned during no one can profit from the marriage the prenup protects the wealthier party
and without it that party is exposed  a sitting duck no wriggle room
youre in a rush

i dont need it
botox christ we had aspirations when we were in college
marylin rexroth she came into my office and signed a prenup with howard doyle
im happy for you pal
he was rex rexroths personal attorney
who was that

it was like that scene in the godfather frankie pentangeli is called to testify against the family and hes in court and he looks into the spectators gallery and sees his brother they brought the brother from sicily and frankie cant say a word he cant testify thats what it was like seeing pat in there i couldnt even have ruth cross examine her

getting married
hes passionate
no you listen to me  you busted me miles you left me with nothing what did you expect me to do get a degree in counseling write a book about table linen because thats what wives do when they get dumped and frankly im not quite ready for that

there you go  grain of salt  two sides to every coin
right
when did you first do business with this bertrand
street cats
recall any names
i always lock my files  and you were the only one here today  what do you mean you son of a bitch
or a cover up  jesus bill dont you have enough proof of the fbis complicity now
bill
correct me if im wrong  i thought we were on the same side  what the hell business is it of theirs to say that
its addressed to no one and no signature  to leave this life is for me a sweet prospect  i find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand everything that is loathsome
yeah  they were seen together in clinton in early september  the civil rights movement was running a voter registration drive
clay bertrand willie
lord wake me please  i must be dreaming
thats fine numa but what about all the people who arent writing letters  theyre sitting home reading all these lies  i just heard nbc crews in town to do a white paper  not on the kennedy killing but on us  one of their top guys harry stoner is talking to everybody he can find about you boss
those bastards  thats proof enough right there of what were up against the whole goddamn federal government bill
all right all right  break it up
i dont buy it chief  why would the fbi cover it up  youre talking the whole fbi here  a telex that disappears from every single fbi office in the country
i know this bill  lyndon johnson got 1 billion for his texas friends brown and root to dredge cam ranh bay for the military in vietnam thats just for openers
with a fullblown conspiracy to cover it up  yever read your shakespeare bill
well it doesnt make sense nick  he was afraid of dying then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes
ever called dean andrews
somebody planted that fucking story and somebody tipped off the press im one of garrisons fucking suspects  i cant go home im out on the street  the maggots are everywhere  do you know what youve done to me  its all over the national news now  you know what youve done to me
you think your investigations been all that secret  you know when you talk to people they talk to other people
did we involve you dave or did clay shaw
what about the mob dave  how do they figure in this
thats not true  i never met anybody named oswald  anybody who told you that has to be crazy
we went straight to houston and then saturday night we drove to galveston and stayed over there
no particular reason  just to go somewhere
dave can i just ask you this directly  did you ever work for the cia
your honor i would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question why did colonel finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck
i dont remember his name  you must understand it was quite crowded and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the president who is dead you dont look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are
are we going away daddy
i realize youre under a great deal of stress  its clouded your judgement
four to six
if we go to him our investigationll hit the front pages by sunrise blow up right in our face  ruby was just given a new trial  if he has something to say itll be there susie what did you find out on oswald
finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has  hes given 5000 rubles a roomy apartment with a balcony has affairs with local girls
the oswalds are introduced by george de mohrenschildt to janet and bill williams  its through janet williams in october 63 that lee gets the warehouse job right smack on elm street at the book depository which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence

i see youre afraid of going to jail eh
all right if you insist on being an idiot im not going to waste time coaxing you  how about you
you know thats the fourth time youve said that today you should have a record made of it
to put it simply i should say that our general belief was in moderation we preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind even including  the excess of virtue itself
we find in the valley it makes for better happiness among the natives we rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience as a result our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy
oh good heavens no
oh no just a little bowled over thats all
i surprise you now thats news
amazing mr chang this place is amazing and that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent oh ive looked around ive seen everything your woodworkers and your clothweavers  they all seem so very very happy
simply preposterous do you know what i did last night last night mr chang i held a sort of a self inventory i said to myself last night mr chang i said lovey  mr lovett mr lovett i said you are an ungrateful fool    
ungrateful fool      those were my very words to myself last night here are these people in shangrila doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and i havent done one single thing to show my appreciation
well mr chang i thought with your permission of course and while im waiting for these porters i would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful geology
oh immediately
oh thank you thank you
we were just going to bury him when you came along
as far away as i ever want to be
oh yes there is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here that is our only contact with the outside world every now and again depending upon favorable weather of course they make the journey
are you taking me
sit here near me i am an old man and can do no one any harm
sondra bizet
the power house  theyve blown it up the planes cant land without lights
hurray for us did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated no you wouldnt say that they dont count
oh stop it
george what are you going to do
oh im feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything  i think im going to like it here
something happened to me when we arrived here george that  well  did you ever go to a totally strange place and feel certain that youve been there before
well  i mean
well  i heard that if you want a mans wife shes yours if hes got any manners
george come back
didnt you find out anything about the porters
you cant take her away from here
she was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were bob
what about the others
bob cant you get them to wait for us theyre leaving us farther behind every day
no thats not possible if we had landed we all would have been awakened
well smash his face in thats what well do
what do you suggest
oh please i hope youre not going to run away this time
oh youve read my books you do more things what have my books got to do with it
a man whose life was empty
im sure of it just as im sure theres a wish for shangrila in everyones heart i have never seen the outside world but i understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy yet i just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security where theres beauty and comfort where they wouldnt have to be mean and greedy oh i just wish the whole world might come to this valley
beautiful im waiting for the bump
well everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself accumulate a nest egg and so on
what is it
now that dinner is over if youll excuse us were very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home
thats what i mean  mysterious mr conway i dont like that man hes too vague
please say you will the days are so very long and lonely without you  please   
you shot an eight year old girl
the hell were you thinking
 think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which i assure you i have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct
well you know when you say normal what exactly
hell of an assistant isnt he  damn guy moves so fast he actually gets there before you even ask for him
so wait  you just asked but he goes so fast he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it
look i dont know why  i could guess however  maybe its your attitude  or that youre not even close to a team player  or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors
helluva night isnt it
well take it from here
its a bug
i think shes the alien  in any case shes clearly spent my too much time alone in this room
im just saying it was cold  i think she kind of liked me
well one things for sure  you could certainly lighten up
why did mikey leave nazca

tonight  lookuhi dont want to seem to be complaining senatorbut in all civilized countries theres an institution called dinner
you get to your feet in the senate and present it then you take the bill and put it in a little box like a letter boxon the side of the rostrum just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in clerks read it and refer it to the right committee
committee
thats how congressor any large bodyis run all work has to be done by committee
lookcommitteessmall groups of senatorshave to sift a bill down look into itstudy itand report to the whole senate you cant take a bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninetysix men where would you get
what
pardon methis is where are we now
yes house more amendmentsmore changesand the bill goes back to the senateand waits its turn on the calendar again the senate doesnt like what the house did to the bill they make more changes the house doesnt like those changes stymie so they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out besides that all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and againstgovernment departments get in their two cents worthcabinet membersbudget bureausembassies finally if the bill is alive after all this vivisection it comes to a vote yes sirthe big day finally arrives andnine times out of ten they vote it down  are you catching on senator
uhhave you  did you ever have so much to say about somethingyou couldnt say it
on paper
well anyway its something like that  and it is important thatthat steering committee has got to see it that way and im sure senator paine will do all he can  hes a fine man miss saunders isnt he he knew my father you know

the chair recognizes the rather strong lunged junior senator mr smith
uhmr presidentyou and i are about to be alone in here sir im not complaining for social reasons but itd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this  mr presidenti call the chairs attention to rule five of the standing rules of the senate section three if it shall be found that a quorum is not present a majority of the senators present and that begins to look like memay direct the sergeantatarms to request and if necessary compel the attendance of the absent senators  mr presidenti so direct

we cant drop it now joe we bought the land around this dam and were holding it in dummy names if we drop it or delay itwe are going to bring about investigations and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the state under phoney names no joe in my judgment the only thing to do is push this dam throughand get it over with
a young patriotwho recites jefferson and lincolnturned loose in our nations capital i think i can
thats him let him in
what do you think
oh i see out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul is that it joe the silver knight is getting to big for us my methods have been all right for the past twenty years joe since i picked you out of a flyspecked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a senator and now you cant stand it well maybe you wont have to stand it joe maybe we can fix it so you and your boy ranger can go home together

oh my god ive dreamed about this ever since i was a little girl

according to my readings our friend suffered the homdai the worst of all ancient egyptian curses one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers in all of my research ive never read of this curse actually having been performed

hi

doesnt it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you cant think of anything to say
being a superhero wanting to save the world its so unselfish
im going inside
listen casanova may be a supervillain but hes got a weakness and im it maybe  just maybe  i can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing
youre the sphinx
you drink too much
it is not dead it is hiding
this place is built like a fortress
we need a break thats all nobodyd ever heard of him until he busted casanova frankenstein
why do they always fill stuff these things so full you cant pull em out without ripping em

so youre only invisible to yourself
yes obiewan
you guys going to a costume party
really
its on the television
and why are you wearing that silly costume
this is bad
be a mohican
its time
where am i going
its a fine thing to establish policies but when they dont work they must be reconsidered  granted that you have hurt england but she is still on her feet  and to seal off her trade with europe what has it cost you  you have had to rule with an iron hand  you have turned friends into enemies  and even at that the result has only been partly effective  you have never been able to stop the extensive cheating smuggling and corruption  even of your own officials  but i should think the situation in spain alone would give your policy a minus balance  you have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas with no victory in sight and you have given england a dangerous foothold on the continent for her armies
your majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine and goes far beyond my official role as ambassador  but i would be remiss in my feelings for you and in my responsibility to the emperor if i did not say that it is entirely possible that the emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the treaty of tilsit as the first step in the exchange of a french alliance for an english one  with all the dangers that might entail
your majesty i have been advised that you have received a letter from napoleon offering a peace treaty and that you have decided to accept it
i believe i am right in saying that before the fire the country had grown weary of the war and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle
i have heard that story but i do not believe it
the point i was trying to make is that i think it is reasonable to say that your majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure if he decided to make peace with the emperor at least at this time
forgive me your majesty i am about to make it
i must confess he would look a bit silly fighting his way to moscow and turning right around again
im glad you like it
yes  who spoke up
thank you for coming  would you care for a drink
i dont have to tell you of our latest difficulties
we expect an attack on the convention tomorrow morning at daybreak and i have been placed in charge of its defense
the 21st dragoons about two or threehundred troopers
there are none here
well i believe there are at least 30 guns at sablons
and where is the army
and who is defending paris
paris has surrendered  i dont believe it
i believe it was arranged by marshals mortier and marmont  i must explain to you that we have had no orders all day  each marshal has been keeping his own position

she should have had larrey or corvisart  they might have saved her but why didnt anyone even write to me  can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me would you have believed that i should read such news in a newspaper  how incredible

now the section headed secret clauses of the treaty  article 14b provides for alexander to serve as mediator between france and england and if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months it further provides that russia is to go to war against england and close her ports to english trade

what i am talking about is moderation
i suggest that you leave with your men while you can

i want to see a friend of mine a very dear friend its a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies its a girl
i must get into that country of yours
now look here you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in you keep him out
what for why
you gave me some very valuable information thank you
does that mean that you want me to go there
then you dont want me to go there
well may i offer you a drink or how about something to eat
and what do you do for mankind
you pronounce it incorrectly ni notchka
you dont have to do a thing chemically we are already quite sympathetic

but leon i am only here for a few days
those newspaper people
was it for this that i refused to endorse dr bertrands mouthwash i could have made a little fortune by saying that the vincent vacuum cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the romanoffs and now you want them to smear my lifes secrets over the front page of a tabloid
first tell me are you my little volga boatman
darling this would be wonderful just once werent you attacked by a bolshevik
make it ice cold
imagine the carpets of a self respecting parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik what does she look like
thank you
did i act stupidly last night should i apologize
is this by any chance going to be a confession
shes gone leon
that does it swana  now you mustnt miss your appointment with your hairdresser
how stale last nights gaiety looks it has the taste of a dead cigarette
thats all right i grow on people
my palace in petrograd yes you took that away from me you took away my czar my country my people everything i had  but nothing more  i warn you
very interesting my dear but couldnt you write all that from moscow a dissertation on love on soviet stationery  would be an amusing paradox
where are they
i am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that fiveforty plane to moscow
you want me to go to constantinople
this way madame are you alone by the window perhaps  or a nice little corner table
bring me something simple i never think about food
no madame something of the utmost importance it concerns your jewels
i remember one birthday of his majesty our beloved czar i had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace i still see you bending before his majesty you wore your diadem and a necklace your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels
mr president i dont know what to say  as soon as we learned from the secret service you were en route the director was notified  he should be here any minute
he told me to take you to his conference room
so what about those watergate clowns john  this fuck siricas crazy thirtyfiveyear sentences  there were no weapons  right  no injuries there was no success  its just ridiculous
executive clemency 
we could get that
i agree its ridiculous but 
i understand that sir
is it
to protect his people
howard youll serve no more than two years then hell pardon you
hes wrong you know  about kennedy lbj truman
sure they did stuff but nothing like this bob  forget watergate the breakins the enemies list  you got an attempted firebombing at the brookings institution planting mcgovern stuff on the guy that shot wallace trying to slip lsd to jack anderson
colson doesnt know about it hes pure as a virgin on this one  its just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for  they were heading to mcgoverns office later that night
hunt  howard hunt
the soldiers were provoked  the students started it for christs sake
hes in the dumps sir  agnew  every time you have him attack the press they give it back to him in spades hes become the most hated man in america
i would personally enjoy doing that sir
itll never wash  pardoning them means were guilty  the people the press will go nuts
 yknow al if hoover was alive none of this wouldve happened  he wouldve protected the president
youre all set sir  just push this button  good night mr president
exactly  weve got to take the war to them  hit em where it hurts  right in the nuts  more assassinations more killings  right al
fucking hell
well why not
should we talk to trini about paying these guys  or maybe chotiner
bob did i approve the ellsberg thing you know im glad we tape all these conversations because  i never approved that breakin at ellsbergs psychiatrist  or maybe i approved it after the fact  someday weve got to start transcribing the tapes
weve got to turn off the fbi  you just go to the cia bob and tell helms that howard hunt is blackmailing the president  tell him that hunt and his cuban friends know too damn much and if he goes public it would be a fiasco for the cia  hell know what im talking about
pat grayll do anything we ask him thats why i appointed him
this isnt a moral issue bob  we have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes  the fbi is filled with people who are pissed that i put gray in and not one of their own  vietnam china the soviet union when you look at the big picture bob youll see were doing a hell of a lotta good in this world  lets not screw it up with some shitass thirdrate burglary
he wasnt protecting me  he was putting me on notice
if they didnt tell kennedy about track 2 how did hoover find out
 never complain never explain john 
but hell this is nothing compared to venezuela  when i was vice president ike sent me down there like a blocking back  they threw rocks broke out our windows almost overturned the car read six crises bob  boy pat was brave
she understood something its taken me twentyfive fucking years in politics to understand  the cia the mafia the wall street bastards 
and his staff  come on the copy they were filing from china was great
so that explains his press notices working both sides of the fence jewboy henry always trying to get his nobel prize get laid 
 i was wondering whats such dynamite in this bay of pigs story   although it was clearly effective because all of a sudden it was no problem for helms to go to the fbi and try to put a lid on watergate
richard  come with me would you 
i see  well then richard we have nothing more to talk about do we
please  ill never let you down again mother  never  i promise
i cant 
oh no harold  he doesnt respond well to humor  maybe if you talk to mother she can 
hey  youll be able to do it now
and me 
it will take a little time but ill order a search for your papers though it does raise a disturbing issue
are you tapping kissinger
not if you have spies in the white house it isnt your job
i want to see him tomorrow clyde
cant we just talk here  ive got the police chiefs in san diego
who we working for
whered you find him
mein kampf
personally id prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed
lets get the fuck out of here shall we ladies
by the way jack this looks like a pretty straightforward transaction to me but we should get into it soon  just take a few minutes maybe up at the house 
only if kennedy dumps johnson
because if youre uncomfortable with the epa up your ass try the irs 
fuck it  he doesnt like me john  its your fault henry
its your people who are leaking to the times  wasnt this ellsberg a student of yours at harvard  he was your idea why are you suddenly running for cover
 as the old alliances crumble
thats right  and if necessary ill drop the big one
youll pick up the middle on this one  the jews and negros
housecleaning  it would be ugly henry really ugly 
uh  not really  you mean on my knees
 uh i hope this doesnt embarrass you
we let you down didnt we  your people
it was illegal what he did
its a thing she does  she talks at night
well he seems to have bought kissinger
uh wait 
 somebody should shoot the little bastard
hi
yeah  guy lombardo 
we didnt come here to talk about football  we came here to end the war
no we dont  youre full of shit you say you want to end the war so why dont you  my brother died over there last november  why  what good was his death
no no  im not powerless  because  because i understand the system i believe i can control it  maybe not control it totally  but  tame it enough to make it do some good
mr president the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute
proud
of them
youre not a failure dick
i sure am  the goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind kennedy  and he was supporting brown people were scared thats why
what are you saying  what are you talking about

thank you colonel im afraid i dont know your name
first you have in your possession certain belongings of mine including clothing private papers furniture and personal effects of a nonmilitary nature which i would like to have returned to me
thank you
that is a separate issue
very well let us move on to
sir
it seems our swamp fox wants to have a formal parley
father a post rider came from charleston  you have a letter inside
rioting both sides of the bay in chestertown they burned the customs house and tarandfeathered the customs agent  he died of burns in wilmington they killed a royal magistrate and two redcoats
did your father teach you humility
how old are you
lord cornwallis is brilliant  his weakness is that he knows it
cheraw falls
we buried them then we went to track  it was a cold trail and they were moving fast  we went faster we caught up to them at kentucky ford
it was a different time son  and youre a better man than that
if this war is about more than thomas its about more than anne as well  stay the course
he wanted to susan but he couldnt leave his men
an american nation  colonel lee with your permission
those of us who call ourselves patriots are not seeking to give birth to an american nation but to protect one that already exists  it was born a hundredandseventy years ago at jamestown virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested  we are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away
a long time ago
we dont have to go to war to gain independence
and your principles
one of yours
ill see to it that he serves under me
were a breath away from losing this war  in the north washington is reeling from valley forge running and hiding from clinton and twelve thousand redcoats  here in the south cornwallis has broken our back  he captured over five thousand of our troops when he took charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and new york
the bigger problem is where not when  the french fleet wont sail north of the chesapeake for fear of early storms
yes quite but you should know that
how many came back
that bad
if cornwallis receives news that clinton is coming hell simply hold tight and wait  hell fight a purely defensive battle and hell win that
not yet thomas
elliegod doesnt do things like that i know you loved ybrother but
please hurry
hurrts it hurrrrts
ive noticed it too ill cough up the money ellen
ellie whats wrong
i dont know honey different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die some believe in heaven or hell some think were born again as little children
do you swear
was it pascow
you need a glass
you folks ready to go on
who owns the woods up ahead paper companies
well theres a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn louis i think it might be your daughters

jud why am i doing all this
i tried to tell myself i buried him alive you knowedgar allan poe meets felix the cat but
rachel not feeling well
i want to wake up i want to wake up thats all i
let her go its cool
my god
youll be fine ellie now you can be excused go and wash your face
not by me it isnt i know how badly i acted how unfair i was its just that iyou know
im going to try to do better
that boat is my livelihood
whats in your head boy
i know whose blood you need to end the curse
the pearl  oh thats fine  and just how do you expect this to work
ill watch my back
the situation has changed
so what now jack sparrow  are we to be two immortals locked in epic battle until the trumpets of judgement day
and how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that  a family heirloom perhaps
oh there would be no sense in killing you miss turner
man overboard
commodore i must protest  pirate or not this man saved my life
elizabeth im relieved youre safe  clap him in irons  and behind his back this time
elizabeth i hereby withdraw my proposal
although  i did think you could wear it to the ceremony today
difficult  to say
youll be dining with the captain and he requests you wear this
what  whats wrong  how will this help us get off the island
drink up me hearties yo ho 
nothing  its nothing  just  im reminded of a song i learned as a child  a song about pirates
well perhaps  with a bit more to drink i might 
mr sparrow  im not sure ive had enough rum to allow that kind of talk
why
you didnt tell commodore norrington everything
whats in your head to put you in such a fine mood
all the men in place sir  ready to fire
you look familiar  have i ever threatened you before
because youre a pirate
i can get you out of here
id die for her
come aboard
for a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats youre a quick study
is that so
you think your father is the only man who ever lived the glasgow life telling folk one thing and then going off to do another theres quite a few who come here hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life and theyre all merchant marines
put it away will  its not worth getting beat again
whats that
jack
theres no real ship as can match the interceptor
hes still breathing
has my daughter given you an answer yet
how long do you leave him in there
mr sim i want you to return to dr brights  i believe she is hiding something of ours there
dr bright i dont have to do anything
i brought you up here dr bright because i want you to understand that we are on the path  the only difference is that you are walking with your head down afraid to look up to see where the path is going
this is our world susan and once you realize that you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven  science is the quest for divine perfection
the body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air there has been nothing sacred about nature nature is the enemy mr obrien and science is our greatest weapon against her
as you can see i am a new man just like you
it works poppy  it works it works
do you think she loves him
can you feel it poppy  the presence of the moment  can you feel the weight of its significance
i was wondering if youd finished considering
did you feel that
theyre here  theyre here  we have the nanobot
of course you understand dr argon that once the nanobot is inside of you there is no going back 
excellent work dr nebbleman  you have outdone yourself
itll be better for us if he simply disappears  the gardener will know what to do
yeah i do
i just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug  what chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you its okay just chuck it
this morning  i saw someone i havent seen in a long time
worse  mrs argon wants to talk to you  shes waiting in the lab
argon is a lunatic  i cant believe i was stupid enough to believe i could control him  you heard what he said nigel  he doesnt care if all of calumet city is turned to jello  how can that not affect you
i think that either youre going to give them to him or hes going to make you give them to him
you want to tell me what im looking for
whats it smell like
like crazy glue
susan
when did you
really  what have you been doing
ive been thinking about you a lot all these years locked up in my cell  id tear through every issue of the midwest science journal looking for your latest findings watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies the fruit fly  exciting stuff  i got to tell you it really kept me going
ive read theyre using it to repair cancer cells
you think its a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this like a little maze were all lab rats running through their maze pulling lever a or lever b each designed to create some kind of biochemical dependency  all the while theyre everywhere watching us twoway mirrors surveillance cameras nodding to each other making little notes
my first organicpolymerization was a lab mouse
why do we need it
oh yeah real funny  yukyuk lets laugh at everything a man believes in
and im sure you thought columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world
come on i dont see you living in a cave
just like old times
i want you to know that i really appreciate you helping me
do you have something to bring me down
whats wrong
you made this out of my hair
run daniel  get out of here

dr royercollard may i be the first to welcome you to charenton 
if you dont mind my asking why has the emperor taken such sudden interest in my our affairs
indiscretions abbe please ive read his case history at sixteen he violated a serving girl with a crucifix after six months in the dungeon at vincennes he mutilated a prostitute cutting her flesh with a razor then cauterizing the wounds with wax 
hes made a great success of our little theater theres seldom an empty seat not to mention its therapeutic value
its essential to his recovery a purgative for the toxins in his mind
you have to believe me i had no idea 
on the contrary let me take up this matter with the marquis myself 
and 
madame bougival mademoiselle clairwil  and of course  the marquis wife 
hell do no such thing
as you say doctor

i assume youve come to plead for clemency on your husbands behalf
youre aware are you not that it costs a great deal to house your husband at charenton
 words alone are insufficient

and youre drinking with them right now
this could go off in a month  or an hour
its too stupid and obvious a way to murder  in full view of fifty windows  and then sit over there    smoking a cigar  waiting for the police to pick him up
youve got a lot to lean about homicide jeff morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them that salesman wouldnt just knock off his wife after dinner toss her in a trunk and put her in storage
almost everythings been done  under panic but this is a thousand to one shot that mans still sitting around his apartment he isnt panicked
his wife took a trip
you told me  ive got to run jeff
i  uh  wont report it to the department let me poke into a little on my own no point in you getting any ridiculous publicity
feel a little foolish
the building superintendent and two tenants flat statements  no hesitation and they all jibed to the letter the thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station
enough to scare me that you wouldnt get here in time and wed lose him
jefferies
didnt i tell you didnt i tell you it was the next place to watch
read some good books
yeah maybe in the high rent districts they discuss  but in my neighborhood they still nag
for a little business meeting  to settle the estate of your late wife
now stop wasting time thorwald or ill hang up and call the police
can you get me that ring back
i cant the police have it by now
i predicted it
stella  in economics a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market absolutely none
you must be kidding a beautiful young woman and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood

nonsense a man is always ready for marriage  with the right girl and lisa fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain who can get one eye open
shes only perfect
keep your mind off her
isnt he a salesman
a federal offense
huh
you mean the one the dog was sniffing around

it doesnt make sense to me whats so different about it here from over there or any place you go that one person couldnt live in both places just as easily
lisa simmer down  will you
did you ever eat fish heads and rice
those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle  and those nylons and sixounce lingerie 
im not exactly on the other side of the room

it doesnt seem to be in any hurry
that alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost 
he had it hidden in the dresser well at least it was in there he took it out went to the phone and called somebody long distance  his wifes jewelry was in the handbag and something about it worried him he was asking somebody advice over the phone
what doesnt
we have all  what
you said id have to live out of one suitcase  ill bet yours isnt this small
do you suppose its ethical to watch a man with binoculars and a long focus lens  until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck and almost read his mail  do you suppose its ethical even if you prove he didnt commit a crime
whatever happened to that old saying love thy neighbor

i told em not to touch the alarm they touched it i blew em full of holes if they hadnt done what i told em not it theyd still be alive
look i dont wanna be a fly in the ointment but if help doesnt come soon i gotta see a doctor i dont give a fuck about jail i just dont wanna die
i wasnt born yesterday im hurt and im hurt bad
uhuh uhuh whats i tell ya that sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho
i dont even know a jew whod have the balls to say that so lets get this straight you never ever tip
do you know what this is its the worlds smallest violin playing just for the waitresses
dead
how the fuck do you think the cops shot him
as opposed to good
what the fuck am i doing here i felt funny about this job right off as soon as i felt it i should said no thank you and walked but i never fucking listen every time i ever got burned buying weed i always knew the guy wasnt right i just felt it but i wanted to believe him if hes not lyin to me and it really is thai stick then whoa baby but its never thai stick and i always said if i felt that way about a job id walk and i did and i didnt because of fuckin money
whats wrong with it
as soon as i heard the alarm i saw the cops
youre right this is bad  how did you get out
did ya see what happened to anybody else
i got the diamonds
i got em all right
so whos the rat this time mr blue mr blonde joe its joes show he set this whole thing up maybe he set it up to set it up
oh you and joe go back a long time i known joe since i was a kid but me saying joe definitely couldnt have done it is ridiculous i can say i definitely didnt do it cause i know what i did or didnt do but i cant definitely say that about anybody else cause i dont definitely know for all i know youre the rat
now youre using your head for all we know hes the rat
so is he dead or what
without medical attention this man wont live through the night that bullet in his belly is my fault now while that might not mean jack shit to you it means a helluva lot to me and im not gonna just sit around and watch him die
so what do you suggest we go to a hotel we got a guy whos shot in the belly he cant walk he bleeds like a stuck pig and when hes awake he screams in pain
well i guess we drop him off at the hospital since he dont know nothin about us i say its his decision
dont fuckin patronize me
is that supposed to be funny
then that time has passed right now mr blonde is the only one i completely trust hes too fuckin homicidal to be workin with the cops
he seems all right now but he went crazy in the store
okay mr expert if this is such a truism how come every nigger i know treats his woman like a piece of shit
you should be maybe lednov heard about that sonora ranch of yours
and thats more important than finding lednov
whats she doin runnin around the country at night
it doesnt matter who they are
anybody hurt
this must have been in the family a long time
you cant leave us here
whats the matter with her
so am i
if you were in his shoes would you take one of us home

theyre stragglin
so that was why she tried to run away
but the rest is right

you should have i dont like leaving things unfinished
im awake now go on say what you want to say ill listen

brenda was right theres more to the story than the professor told us i found a secret room it had all these news clippings about hugh kane he was a very evil man
and remember that trip we took to africa that safari was so wonderful me you best of friends forever
oh i guess ill die now
my favorite memory was when we 
you know buddy about this friendship thing
oh yeah another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy more feminine and her tits are perfect not pointy and funny looking or spaced too far apart
where the hell are we
better try a little higher
i know but ive been thinking 
listen to me i 
look what im trying to say 
hey look out a bee

im sorry
left right left right crossover kick
that was a great idea shorty
alright cindy whats so important
no im just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals and it is likely it did attack but it doesnt mean it was possessed maybe the two of you should sleep together
good idea and dont forget to give her a goodnight kiss
here you go professor
yes the scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter just like you asked for
as i am sure you are aware professor subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation which is of course why ive given them special consideration
professor
the force in this house is far greater than i anticipated in one night i recorded cold spots shifting magnetic fields the eup is picking up white sounds everywhere
yes but ive seen the tapes this poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent we all could be in danger i say we pull the plug
hello dwight

detectives what is this about

hi hank

i just thought with all the sadness you wouldnt want
beverly not the sterners
did you recognize the voice of the caller
whos voice was it dottie
hello
listen to your dirty mouth you fucking whore
its him
its just not your day is it rosemary
thats like your car beverly
you want me to keep that under the table for you
beverly honey youve got some  dodo on your shoe
that was your people magazine with the letters cut out wasnt it
dr sutphin said no sweets for you
then you know that if i give you a little advice itll be good advice
that girl was looking for jacqueline gibson id forget it if i were you
the name may not mean anything to you young lady but say the word and ill have your sister for you in fortyeight hours
ive been waitin for you miss gibson i want you to know ive decided to take your case
thats what i tried to find outi went to la jeunesse    used a phony health inspectors badge  they let me go through the works  all but one room that room was locked id like to see the inside of that room
you cant tell
sister you cant just go breaking into places theres a night watchman down there and locks on the door
we cant stand here all night
the acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret you understand that dont you
 i didnt she came to me a few days ago to put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me she thought you might lighten that burden
im afraid she cant do that ward it would endanger her
how much does she want
but tell me 
hows miss jacqueline
i cant see much fun in teaching school why dont you go into the beauty business
the morgue no wonder you fainted  i wish you had come to me first
but id give a great deal to know
at least i can explain that mary your sister had a feeling about life  that it wasnt worth living unless one could end it i helped her get that room
this is about another murder  a woman at fifty second street
yes of course  but the police would say youd probably had a bad dream
its not much money but its enough to live on youd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room
please  i cant explain things like this to your right ear
who the devil is he
shes got to be found thats the first step shes got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police
dont we know what happened dont go on
that was dr judd he was phoning to say that jacqueline is on her way here 
but i understand her that may be more important
whats that
and you dont want to die ive always wanted to die  always
im tired of being afraid  of waiting
goodbye darling ill only be gone until three
and you knew hed be here
my window   through which i see the world
you went to see mrs redi she told you something  what was it
and you believe that
he loves you mary and youll have to tell him
jason my pet 
because there was another girl years ago  a nice girl she lived on barrow street i saw her with you once  i saw her with you twice and then i never saw her again thats why
i think i understand without your telling me i know something of your history jason i know that you havent written for ten years
and this poetry  like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life
yes when i tell you
i suppose jason that youll speak for your friend    and your poetry will speak for you
dont be so amazed its a very ordinary matter im jacquelines physician mr ward told me you were in town and jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her
id hardly describe it that way  the worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing
i think i can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation i know too much i was jacquelines psychoanalyst
ive talked nonsense ive scoffed and hooted  but somewhere very deep down in me i always felt that good held the balance of power
but you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister
once youd seen my sister youd never forget her
because i have something very important to do
im sorry to be late natalie
jacqueline you have spoken so often of ending it all i cant understand why this should be so difficult for you you have only to drink a little
have you ever been on television
oh uhhuh
oh uhhuh
nine years
why didnt you know him well
do i pay taxes of course i pay taxes only a liar doesnt pay taxes im not a liar a liar is the second lowest form of human being
maybe youll understand this because you know john but he confuses me sometimes
yeah i know i mean im not saying i know people think youre a bitch im saying i know what you mean and i dont even know that people think youre a bitch do they
i know that i just dont feel a connection with very many people so i dont waste time with people i dont feel one with
can i tell you something personal i feel like i can its something i couldnt tell john or wouldnt anyway
why is that
as long as its not gross you know like some scar or something it has to be like mine like something about you
well are you selfconscious about it
arent you
well my therapist knows me intimately
oh just a personal project like anyone elses personal project mines just a little more personal
this is just so
i want you to be aware of what youre doing and why because i know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind
thats a good question
load a new tape turn the camera on
how do you pay for all this i mean rent and tapes and this equipment
tell me your name
i guess not
no
her name was elizabeth
interesting analogy
you should be he lied to you so did cynthia
ive told you
but why cant you just put it all behind you cant you just forget it all that stuff you did
thats the first thing that ran through my mind when i saw you i thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade
then maybe i saw an old message there are a lot of them on my desk you know
no im not frankly im offended at the accusation
what
why
answer me godammit did you make one of those tapes
goddam right
you son of a bitch
yes i remember what do you do when these moods overtake you
no i didnt
do you have any idea what triggered this concern
if you think about it i think youll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldnt possibly have any control over
prior to this feeling were you comfortable having physical contact with him
what do you mean
god no
yes its this radioactive gas in the ground and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up and  youve never heard of this
what visitor
oh graham no i didnt talk to him about that actually that turned out to be pretty interesting i expected graham to be this well like john you know i mean he said they had gone to school together so i was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff but he turned out to be this this kind of character i mean hes kind of arty but okay you know
what brought this on
do you want to leave therapy
i hate my sister
because cynthia look john was right graham is strange very strange you dont want to get involved with him
no
apparently
yes i did
he wouldnt do that
well its too late now isnt it
listen to you you sound like mom what are you talking about
why
hes harmless he just sits around and looks at these tapes whats the big deal
ann i dont understand why this freaks you out so much you didnt do it i did and if it doesnt bother me why should it bother you
do you have my work number
i get real busy between two and four
bye
who are you
she called you that too may i ask why youre here
no i really cant i find it healthy never to characterize people i dont know or conversations i havent heard i dont know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else last time i saw ann she left here very confused i would say and upset
well they must be something sexual because ann gets freaked out by that shit are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something
doing what
you just want to ask me questions
id rather sit are you ready
how unfortunate so when did you finally get to see a penis
what did he say
no
well maybe i could just start a rumor then

can you meet me and sartorius on b deck in an hour
youre unnerved because youve spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you and suddenly your subconscious is an open book  we are for the first time experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own  that proves that

what do i have to do to stop it
is that really what you want
i wish you wouldnt
you have to remember that i love you thats all that matters 
ive decided that if it is god its a sick god  its ambitions exceed its powers but it doesnt realize it  its created a situation without a goal and i hate that  a god whose passion is not a redemption who saves nothing fulfills no purpose  and us  we would have to have an arrangement  an unspoken understanding that i am not human how can i not hate something that does that
he wont do it
followed by nonhuman manifestations

damn it jim what the hells the matter other people have birthdays whyre we treating yours like a funeral
dont mince words bones tell me what you really think
it never rains but when it pours 
go uwhereu are we going
dr marcus good were en route to you and should be there in three days
 please help us jim wont let them have without proper repeat on whose authority
david was right wasnt he its just to keep them busy
well dont have kittens genesis is going to work theyll remember  you in a wreath with newton einstein surak
will you please be quiet we must have order here  this has to be some sort of mistake
i told you i told you i saw a 
beyond what i told you sir it is classified information
hes on a build up to detonation
what are you looking at
careful not all at once utheu uengine roomu lock on target and prepare to fire
yours is the superior
 but i wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you i khan noonian singh the eagle you attempted to cage forever
times up admiral
goodbye admiral oh and dont count on enterprise she cant move my next act will be to blow her out of the heavens
i dont know you but you i never forget a face mister chekov isnt it  i never thought to see your face again
uhura cant you augment
shes not responding
im getting a voice message wait  short range band they say their chambers coil is shorting their comm system
mr scott on discrete
midshipman youre a tiger
admiral ive got to take the mains off the line the energizers shaken loose and i cant get in there to fix her  radiation 
if he hadnt wed be space by now
and who is this
so you said at the time speaking of which your protgs first rare  a trifle emotional 
theres a first time for everything admiral
there are two possibilities sir they are unwilling to respond they are unable to respond
twelve hours and fortythree minutes present speed
their coil emissions are normal wait their shields are going up theyre locking phasers  
not enough against their shields
establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when youve talked with mr scott
thats it
kirk here
how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life wouldnt you say
indeterminate life signs
whats on your mind lieutenant
how
hold your course look sharp
cease fire look sharp
yes well why dont you show him around and
i really must thank you
stop engines
fire all phasers
all moorings are clear captain
you lied
to earth to offer testimony
you  sent them away without even letting me say goodbye
youd think they could at least send a ship bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite  but to come home in this klingon flea trap
bones 
youre really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket
i prefer a dose of common sense you are proposing to head backwards in time find humpback whales then bring them forward in time drop them off  and hope they tell this probe what to do with itself
jim youve got to let me go in there dont leave him in the hands of twentieth century medicine
forget it  how bout covering a little philosophical ground life death life things of that nature
there are millions of other species on earth doctor only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man
10 million years earlier humpbacks were heavily hunted by man they have been extinct since the 21st century it is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact
naturally  so what is your problem
guess spock your best guess
fundoscopic examination 
whats causing that
my name is pavel chekov i am a lt commander in starfleet united federation of planets service number 6565827b
my name
i do not know your name
no sir and no federation wessels on assigned patrol stations
status report admiral
they are mature humpbacks weighing 45000 pounds each they wandered into san francisco bay as calves and were brought here we call them george and gracie
hes harmless  back in the sixties he was part of the free speech movement at berkeley i think he did too much lds
memory problems too
hes just going to hang around the bushes while we eat
where could you take them
my whales where could you take them where theyd be safe
 who are you
are you kidding i wouldnt miss this for all the tea in china
well admiral that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story ive ever heard
its true what you said
steady now we need your help
its all real look  the storage tanks for the whales
what kind of spaceship is this anyway
permission to come aboard
thank you admiral
where are you going
that leaves us no choice we must destroy the probe before it destroys earth
earth but when spock
we could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber causing crystalline restructure theoretically
werent those a birthday present from dr mccoy
admiral may i ask you a question
its her  from the institute if we play our cards right we may learn when those whales are really leaving
admiral full power is restored
no admiral but is the human thing to do
unidentified aircraft 40000 feet msl range 30 miles bearing 010
i cant sir  nothing
mr scott how soon can we get underway
youll work it out scotty and remember two of them
scotty are the whale tanks secure
full power sir
the whales
the explosive override  
genesis was perfectly named the creation of life not death it was the klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets
with pleasure
yes i noticed now suppose  just suppose  i could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick would that be worth something to you eh
hello computer
as i recall i opposed your enlistment in starfleet it is possible that judgment was incorrect  your associates are people of good character
ojichan akira ojichaan dewa naino koko de nani shiteru no  
ah sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira  ah then i am sure that you will have a long and happy life
we were under the impression they were being held against their will
my people have a strict policy of noninterference with other cultures in fact its our prime directive
dont panic
theres an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planets rings it continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies you must have noticed the effects by now
most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down
the craftsmanship is extraordinary
seeing my home planet from space for the first time
i wonder if youre aware of the trust you endanger jeanluc picard in my experience its unusual for
youre rotin arent you theres something in the voice  would you be his friend galna  i helped your mother bathe you when you were a child she still speaks of you
dont you ever get tired
because youre it and if you tag me then im it
data havent you ever just played for fun
why not
can he breathe under water
captain the sona hostages declined to be examined i had them confined to quarters
you either need a new uniform or a new neck
his nose should pant and his lip should curl
tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills
a ship
youre not going to launch anything until
the prime directive doesnt apply these people are not indigenous to this world they were never meant to be immortal well simply be restoring their natural evolution
there are six hundred people down there well be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions  the sona have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings
on earth petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders warp drive transformed a bunch of romulan thugs into an empire we can handle the sona im not worried about that
our best scientific minds already have we cant find any other way to do this
but i would need at least three minutes on the bridge
the injector performs perfectly in every simulation
i dont believe it happened that way
his ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions
in a sense thats all he knew the system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss
implants bothering you
commander im showing two sona ships on an intercept course
nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey
you must be planning on doing some hunting
my name is sojef captain
i i must have slept through my alarm im on my way
captain
you need a haircut commander
the baku could use some rest sir according to the geoscan this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers
all injector subsystems are confirmed offline
one its ruafo

counselor
nomadic collectors of precious metals jewels

good hunting hayes out
admiral whats the status of the borg fleet
montana  energize
cochrane the inventor of warp drive
but hes been dead for three hundred  oh god weve gone back in time again havent we
are you saying they wont help us
there must be some good people even in this time
beverly there were many reasons why you and i
the occipital fracture is widening were going to have to fuse the bones
that is not true they have tried to help me
i am grateful for what you have given me but i still do not wish to be assimilated
yes
the borg ship has modified its shields captain our phasers will no longer be effective
but now they are all one with the borg
who are you
data are you sure youre all right
apr cell count what the hell are you talking about
what did you do to the batteries
maybe  sure yeah as long as i could get a clear look at the intake configuration but so far we havent found any other photos
whats still there
the vulcans should be out there right now we need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if were going to get their attention
passing onehalf light speed the starboard nacelles running a little hot
captain the enterprise
theyre getting awfully close what the hell are they doing
where are you from most recently
and what were you doing out at the missile silo
lucky for him you came by when you did he might be dead now
what do you want
invasion
money so you can get dome money
it cant wait until tomorrow
we
lie thats one keep going
signal the endeavor to fall back well cover them
hull integrity down to thirty percent
looks like they damaged the silo
yes sir but captain are we all going back
i have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems so far theyve had no success
a shipwide decompression has been initiated
what the hell is happening worf
what are they doing
worf im going to need at least five minutes
emergency override
worf to bridge were about to enter the environmental control room
worf is something wrong
captain theyre firing at a nuclear missile silo in central montana
bet you wish youd stood in bed
calm yourself doctor the operation is almost complete
no
that was the general idea i intended to convey
its the viridium patch spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard gorkons ship
damned clever if you ask me
too bad we cant smell her
are you carrying a surgeon
i tried to save him i was desperate to save him he was the last best hope in the universe for real peace
my god what happened here
spoken by you
you were demoted
captain youre not going to show them the bridge
shes here  somewhere
shields battle stations
mr chekov take us forward thrusters only one half impulse power
mr chekov slow down take us forward thrusters only one quarter impulse power
klingon blood
you must have cursed yourself for having programmed our data banks lieutenant only they revealed something wrong aboard enterprise
captain im getting a message from klingon high command
your research laboratory is most impressive
thank you captain kirk the evening has been most edifying
ive heard of chameloids  shapeshifters  i thought you were mythical
i know how to get outside the shield
i gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment i dont think many on board are
captain our shields  
who is us
standing by captain kirk
we volunteered
dont trust them dont believe them 
i believe the captain feels that starfleets mission has always been one of peace 
captain
her own father
but it was when you tried to persuade me the captain was guilty that i should have understood
apparently theyre refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock sir
i have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port 
no way
its as i said mr spock inventory still registers every torpedo
that could take hours
and if theyre still in place
twentyfour hours from now we wont have a clue where the captain is
sulus giving us his position and telling us hes standing by
an ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains  however improbable  must be the truth
can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you
can you remember our father
i do not understand
indefinitely
remember him
i so wanted to believe shinzon but the thalaron radiation cant be explained away whatever hes after its not peace
to seek out new life and new civilizations zephyr cochrans own words when charles darwin set out on the hms beagle on his journey into the unknown he sailed without a single musket
sir  i noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding i am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse laughter through tears but i could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously
the closest signature is two kilometers to the west that direction sir
my mission was a success sir i have discovered the source of the thalaron radiation
for now we see but through a glass darkly he said hes a mirror
yes
but so much is the same on a biological level he is and i will not accept the idea that there is nothing i can do i have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him
yes sir the rift effects all longrange communications
why am i looking at me
captain picard agrees that the b9 was probably designed with the same selfactualization parameters as myself if my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix he should have all my abilities
i feel nothing geordi it is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual
but i believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions
may i have this dance
its about data  ive watched him with the b9 and im troubled datas desire for a family is very strong im afraid he may be investing too much in the b9
the b9 is like a slow child sir and data in his own way has assumed the position of a parent or guardian im afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences hell be disappointed when the bi9 cannot meet those expectations
sir the strongest sense i had was that hes more than urious about you he very much wants to know you  the same way you want to know him
captain  i might have a way to find them
but how can he hell kill you
ill always be with you now now and forever
no
thats what i dont get  its mostly basic stellar cartography star charts communications protocols some uplinks from colony tracking stations its not even restricted material
hes getting his cloak back we have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes phaser banks are down to four percent
sir were being hailed

i wont do it
im picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the kolarin system
were being hailed
sir weve had an unauthorized access into the main computer
we have to assume he had romulan collaborators
why dont they answer our hails
not very chatty
sir
anything
praetor
i want to end the centuries of mistrust i want to be your ally not your enemy as a first step i propose we eliminate the neutral zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas
right now youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true
no one knew what to do finally i was taken to a doctor who had some experience with terran illnesses and i was finally diagnosed with shalafts syndrome do you know of it captain
and when i was ready they were going to replace you with me an exact biological duplicate put a romulan agent at the heart of starfleet toinfluence your command structure it was a bold plan
romulan ale  im surprised i cant stand it
hello jean luc
what are you doing
maybe ill train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does  or maybe ill snap its ugly head off
its about destiny picard about a reman outcast who
i see an old man set in his ways afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a starfleet regulation to tell him what to do i see the man i will never be
not so long
report
well that sounds relaxing too
believe it or not i think the cavalry has arrived
the bond is broken

its a nono
ive been thinking about this
just routine stuff
maybe we should back off a bit
my watch he toyed with me he sent me to chicago

i dont know that i can do that mrs marsh
i didnt mean it that way  i meant only that i am not in a position to ask favors

dr macfarlane 
you know how we get the specimens we use for dissection

two down two to go
that was a fucking hollow point
fuck what do you want
sssshhh shes resting

we had our atomic wars  thousands of years ago  after that we fought with bows and arrows then slowly we learned that fighting is no solution  that aggression leads to chaos
i came here to warn you that by threatening danger your planet faces danger  very grave danger i am prepared however to offer a solution
what about your personal safety in the meantime what about the army  and the police
something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation something that would affect the entire planet

perhaps if you could explain a little
good afternoon  im glad to see you up and around
now that you understand the situation more clearly perhaps youd like to discuss the matter with the president

these people are contemptible they have no sense of dignity at all
it couldnt have come from anywhere else at least somewhere from that vicinity but i really cant understand it contraband cigarettes on that island its the first time that ever happened
but how could weat a time like this when we just well lets at least first have a look around the other islands could be that something might turn up there

patrizia patrizia  wheres ettore
patrizia im afraid

theyre all nudes if im not mistaken
its as smooth and slick as oil
corrado why dont you ask them to give it to us as a gift
up until now those smugglers were operating only around the palermo area this will be a nice surprise for the lieutenant in milazzo call up headquarters bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate
but for what reason would she have wanted to go away
ettore
oh there are as many as one wants
but why me ask claudia shes much more beautiful than me
i work there but im really a stranger
we have a radio like this too
and why wouldnt we have one like this
anything new develop
very well first of all ill have them search the waters around the island i brought two frogmen with me meanwhile well take a look up around here
dont worry weve got everything
then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in noto are there any hotels or rooming houses
did you manage to find good rooms
now tell the truth arent you a bit disappointed but i already told you
youve made some mistake there with the bushes thats why you cant finish it
agnes it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating why is this agnes  ive been commanded by god
god blew up the hindenburg hell blow me up thats what she said
it made them uncomfortable and if they didnt sleep well im certain the next day they were cranky as mules sister where are your sheets  do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin
a few years ago one of the sisters came to me in tears asking for comfort comfort because she was too old to have any children not that she wanted to but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility
what do you mean
down there
what do you mean
are you married
do you have any children
no wonder wait agnes agnes how do you feel about babies
agnes i dont believe you know nothing about sex
but youre troubled arent you
and youre unhappy
you can tell me
shes dead isnt she
she tells you youre ugly
what
agnes youre stupid
youre a mistake
and why am i here
why
no not yet agnes very soon but not yet how did the baby get into you
oh dont be im here its alright i want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed
you dont like brussel sprouts
a crucifix
a wastepaper basket
why isnt anyone coming
she said michael
yes
shed seen him too
stay away from me
god  it was god  and now ill burn in hell because i hate him
mother miriam was with you wasnt she
she took the baby in her arms
ive been watching we were fine till she came she brought the devil here  there was blood on her hand that night
look into the convent records
the longer you take to make a decision the more difficult it will be for us
larry
maybe theres something thats not in the report that should be
did you have a good week mama are they treating you all right
oh that one there in the corner
oh we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case
im afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age
you can call me sister
how did she hide it during the day
didnt she have any physical examinations in this time
what man had access to her
exactly i want you do deal with agnes as speedily and as easily as possible she wont hold up under any sort of cross examination
well what do you think  is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre or maybe shes perfectly sane and just a very good liar
i believe agnes is different
in her case it isnt shes had very little schooling her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died agnes came here to us shes never been out there doctor shes never seen a movie or a television show shes never even read a book
you dont really believe something like that happened do you
this convent is locked solid the only one that has a key is sister marguerite and she wouldnt let christ in after dark
this was before her pregnancy
catholicism is not on trial here i want you to deal with agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else
im only interested
what good would it do no matter what you decide its either the the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin
how
all right what do you need
do you have a a diary or a day book
theres nothing here
she molested her
why didnt you do anything to stop her
would you like one  huh
saint ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet  and of course 
do you want to become one
there as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out
theres a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn did you know about that theres an answer mother thats how she got out
who was that person mother  was it you
this is permission to take her apart
and you didnt send her to a doctor
you wanted that child out of the way
and the baby
before or after you killed the child
oh dont be so stroppy
you heard it gets on my wick
yeah
can you fix him for me
sure
boys you dont know what this means to me if you hadnt come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in welsh for life

some plain soda  lloyd must be expecting a record run in new haven
so thats it lloyd still just the theater after all
i know nothing about lloyd and his loves  i leave those to louisa may alcott but i do know you
lloyd richards is commercially the most successful playwright in america
what do you mean by that
belong  to you that sound medieval  something out of an old melodrama
youre too short for that gesture besides it went out with mrs fiske
your name is not eve harrington it is gertrude slescynski
a matter of opinion granted it is also true that you worked in a brewery but life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it as a matter of fact it got less and less dull  until you bosss wife had your boss followed by detectives
im tired i want to go home
in my case its necessary too many taxi drivers write plays
then stop being a star  start treating your guests as your supporting cast
margo lunching in public
it wasnt reading it was a performance brilliant vivid something made of music and fire
bill
shes quite a girl that whatsher name
i told her i sounded off
am i going to lose you bill am i
its a good thought
dont let me kill the point or isnt it a story for grownups
ive always denied the legend that you were in our american cousin the night lincoln was shot
thirty minutes forty minutes what of it
now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible
addison
poor little flower just dropped her petals and folded her tent
well you neednt i will not be tolerated and i will not be plotted against
no ill tell it to you for the last time ill tell it to you because youve got to stop hurting yourself and me and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums
well i am
i wish it were
i  i dont know bill just a feeling i dont know
never try to outguess margo
why
but hollywood you mustnt stay there
dont run away bill
youre always after truth  on the stage what about off
then face it i have since that first night  here  in the dressing room
lemme fix you a drink
margo does not play a lunatic birdie
she too is a great admirer of yours
but the wardrobe women have got one and next to a tenor a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business
you dont like eve do you
theres some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers whod you call  the william morris agency
there was nothing he didnt know  theres a message from the bartender does miss channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake
thats all
the maidll fix it in the morning
bill sampson hes  hes a director
hell agree with you tell me what do you between the time margo goes in and comes out just huddle in that doorway and wait
you look just fine   by the way whats your name
now whos show up at this hour its time people went home  hold that coat up   whose is it
then  would you talk to mr fabian about it
oh but there is
eve dont cry
you want to play cora you want me to tell lloyd i think you should play it
no thank you  yes ive seen every performance
back to copacabana but eve margo let me tell you about eve
please dont misunderstand me mr richards i think that part of miss channings greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays your new play is for miss channing isnt it mr richards
well if i didnt come to see the play i wouldnt have anywhere else to go
did you see it here in new york
what  again
i can imagine you know all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there  are you sure you wont want it yourself
right here
well i was sure youd want to of course being his birthday and youve been so busy these past few days and last night i meant to tell you before you went out with the richards  and i guess i was asleep when you got home
well if youd been here to begin with i wouldnt have dared to read at all
shes just outside the door
dear birdie wont you sit down miss worthington
that little place just two hours form new york its on my list of thingsillneverunderstand like collecting shrunken indian heads
any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas
about eve ive acted pretty disgracefully toward her too
in this rat race everybodys guilty till theyre proved innocent one of the differences between the theater and civilization   what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance
i remember
 ats my loyal little woman
you cant put her out i promised margo youve got to see her she worships you its like something out of a book
its just possible she didnt
 dont run out of adjectives dear
no i got the idea myself  while she was talking to me
margo channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise
well of all
would you really how sweet
whos left out there
you disapprove of me when im like this dont you
cora shes  still a girl of twenty
dont you think its about time it became important
spoken like an author  lloyd im not twentyish i am not thirtyish three months ago i was forty years old forty four oh  that slipped out i hadnt quite made up my mind to admit it now i feel as if id suddenly taken all my clothes off
im sure you underestimate yourself eve you always do  you were about to tell me about eve

woodward

i dont know anything about haldeman except dwights frightened of him everybodys frightened of himchrist i wish id never gotten messed around with thisall i wanna do is sit in the sun sit swim see some girls
cant help you
hannah i never would have bothered you but im off to miami and theyre gonna take away my ten speed unless i get it straightened out fast
hey very tense
youre a sex junkie you know that carl
this is practically a high school reunion for us janei would have sprung for a classier place
if you dont like it down there why dont you quit
youve really got to go
i was just curiousyou dont do it well so i wondered have you been threatened if you told the truth is that it
its awfully hot  and you havent finished telling me about the money
try and understand this im a decent republican i believe in richard nixon i worked in the white house four yearsso did my wife what happened on june 17 i dont think the president knew anything about some of his men im not so sure of
we were never told flat out dont talk but the message was clear
but they both worked at the white house
what happens when the baby comes
i really cant talk now
im not your source on that
if we wrote a story that said haldeman controlled the fund
then its our asses isnt it
lookwhy would the republicans do it my god mcgovern is self destructing before our eyesjust like muskie did humphrey the bunch of em  why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught why did they take a walkie talkie and then turn it off unless they wanted to get caught why would they use mccordthe only direct contact to the republicans
just tell me his title
anything else from mr throat
probably youre right but a little while ago i was talking to a couple of lawyers whod been assigned to represent the burglars
are you implying you dont believe me
the twentyfive thousand dollar one  the one with your name on it  in bernard barkers florida account  bernard barker the watergate burglar
i dont know i really dont the last time i saw it was when i was in washington i gave it to the finance department of the committee to re elect the president how it got to that burglar your guess is as good as mine
i saw the flag signalwhats up
follow the money always follow the money
melodramatic  things are past thatremember these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were dodge city
what i know youll have to find out on your own
in my day it was simply called the double cross i believe the cia refers to it as mindfuck in our context it simply means infiltration of the democrats
i hope you noticed how coolly i behaved under the threat of discovery
someone with authority id imagine wouldnt you  dont you know what youre onto come on
why did they do all this for chrissakeswhat were they after
there were more then
the canuck letterwas that a white house operation
i know i know the pressures off the white house and its all back on the post
you know the paper was my fathers and my husbands when they were alive and i was thinking back a year or two ago when ben called me and said he wanted to publish the pentagon papers the next day the times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said dont dont and i was frightened but i knew if i said no id lose the whole fifth floor so we published and that night after id told ben to go ahead i woke up in the darkness and i thought oh my lord what am i doing to this newspaper  i woke up again last night with that same question  are we right on this story
and the underground garage one  would i know him
absolutelyand thats all they do sit sit sitevery once in a while they call up a senator some reporting
ok get on this whouse guy and do a better job then you did on mccord
then how come the associated press were the ones found out that mr mccord is security coordinator for the committee to reelect the president otherwise known as creep
whatd you get on whouse
whos charles colson
has any of them got an ax
more denunciations
what else have you got
isnt that what youd expect them to say
the report on the cash in maurice stans safe the three hundred fifty thousand thats true

im sure simon they did something real off for you to feel this way but when it comes to your partners  or your kid  things will always be off for you unless you set it straight maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance
thats not true some of us have great stories pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad just not anybody in this car but lots of people  thats their story  good times and noodle salad and thats what makes it hard not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good

yes  it didnt matter much to them as long as i disappeared
the only thing different about the private sector is that a general contractor takes less of a percentage than the government so you make more money  then once you make the transition you realize you were never working for the government it was always the private sector the vested interests and its the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets

your mother wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon and that if you were interested in going to the dance saturday shes available
apparently what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mothers emotional behavior
thats exactly what i said i mean a guy and his mother  thats illegal isnt it

i guess if im going to be dead ill just have to be the best dead person ever
is this a punishment for something we did in life  what can we do
barbara honey  dont go out there  you dont know 
look in the index maybe theres like an emergency number or something
thats it  no number or instructions
what about this beetle guy
go ahead third times a charm
what happened
has anything been simple so far from the look of the shovel we dig
weve been given a gift here honey  a real live little girl she likes us a lot  she needs us maybe thats why we died so young to keep us from getting so attached to uthingsu  the house antiques your model  look at us we didnt have room for anyone
you tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house
ubarbarau
hell is other people  you obviously dont read much besides things seem pretty quiet here  you should thank god you didnt die in italy  the deetzes  okay  have you been studying the manual
all right  who are you
id nearly given up on you  i was about to leave  i do have other clients
no
hes a freelance bioexorcist claims to get rid of the living but hes a troublemaker  hes pushy  hes been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years
the whorehouse was my idea i want betelgeuse out of the picture  weve got some serious talking to do
tell the truth
we cant  we havent left the house since the funeral
i hate you  i cant trust anybody
i want to be dead too
so uneveru let beetle juice out never  besides  were thinking about letting everyone stay you and your father and mother can stay too
howd you do on the science test
look at me think of me as cash this offer is really real  from a rich man in new york city who only saw a photograph
you could double the size of your hardware store  youll be rich
you do  over here  on umyu side
three syllables
beetle
you were the snake  right  i know  i saw you
otho
i feel like weve been at war charles
otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration
theyre probably guilty about what they did to me
where is your mother
the attic room is locked 
well be utheu art center of summer new york  ill teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture  and when otho and i get through with this house you people are not going to recognize it
i think the reason is they were trying to scare you and you didnt get scared 
lydia i will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors  you help us with these ghosts or youll be sorry
is the rest of the house as bad as this
otho i canunotu uliveu with these cheap domestic floor tiles
i will tell you what is boring  once you cover up the wallpaper knock down a few walls alter the traffic patterns and  perhaps  only perhaps  think about an inground pool  the place umightu just be livable  whats on the third floor
it does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts  that they actually appear in usheetsu
they dont want to come down
all presences have a home space a place where they live so to speak  where do they hide out
perhaps if i were properly motivated
their wedding clothes
just to take the proper precautions mr gardiner id recommend we take you downstairs and xray your leg   by the way mr gardiner i would like to ask you something straight out
then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys
i swear chauncey between you and benjamin ive got my hands full   say that is coming along the swelling has gone down considerably   any pain here
 benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his financial institute today but obviously the strain would be impossible how about here chauncey any soreness
 oh   my god i only wish that benjamin had your recuperative powers anyway the president offered to sit in for ben at the meeting quite a nice gesture i felt hes due here soon i believe
he does does he
a rather large contusion but i dont feel there is any serious damage id like to keep an eye on him though  i suggested that he stay here for a couple of days
how true mr gardiner may be a welcome change of pace
at times yes but thats not an uncommon reaction to such an accident actually i found him to have quite a sense of humor
another thing that baffles me doctor  what was his connection with the deceased major financial dealings obviously  but our firm has no record of any such transactions
do you know raphael
a black man gave me the message
oh mr gardiner ive been looking all over
may i ask your name
i hope that staying here wont be an inconvenience for you
 and ben is just mad about you  youve lifted his spirits so  its just well its just a real pleasure having you with us
 chauncey last night you mentioned an old man that died
what is that
chauncey i just wanted to wish you well i know youll be smashing
and benjamin sends along his best wishes
oh well we can fix up one of bens for you tomorrow night sophie insists an black tie
 good night chauncey
 you know chauncey i want us to be  i want us you and i to become close i want us to become very close you know
i feel so close to you so safe with you chauncey   and benjamin understands that dearest he understands and accepts my feelings for you
mr gardiner im morton hull the producer of this evening
do you realize mr gardiner that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years
you must sit with us my friend we have much to discuss
im sorry we havent met sooner mr gardiner i had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and i listened with great interest to your downtoearth philosophy im not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the president   tell me mr gardiner just how serious is benjamins illness i did not want to upset mrs rand by discussing it in detail
welcome to rand memorial hospital mr gardiner
no thank you my house has been closed
a gardener well put chauncey excellent isnt that what a businessman is a gardener a person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands who waters it with the sweat from his own brow and who creates a place of value for his family and community yes chauncey what a brilliant metaphor  yes indeed a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard
its a very pleasant room ben
hes a decent fellow the president isnt he
and please chauncey  dont rush your decision i know youre not a man to act on the spur of the moment
tell eve you mean mrs rand
may i help you mr gardiner
 sir
 did you wish to see someone sir
its starting to swell is it painful
how long do we stay in here
dammit boy is that all you got to say more gobbledegook  that old mans layin up there dead as hell and it just dont make any difference to you
 well your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on
yes of course you know mr gardiner that i always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests i hope you dont object to that
fine then lets get started the current state of our country is of vital interest to us all and i would like to know if you agree with the presidents view of the economy
come now mr gardiner before his speech at the financial institute the president consulted with you and benjamin rand did he not
well let me rephrase the question the president compared the economy of this country to a garden and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow do you go along with this belief
well mr gardiner from the sound of our audience id say that your words are a most welcome respite from what weve been hearing from others
louise the maid  but she should have left earlier today
have you served in the army
 do you drive this mr chance
good morning mr president
yes i will
sure try again  where theres nothing its like he never existed
oh im very sorry well if you have any need for any of our facilities please do not hesitate to ask
thank you greta  ill be with mr rand if im needed
come on eve lets let the men talk there are so many people that have been asking about you
 how are the kids getting along
 is it me is there something ive done
quietly please mr gardiner for one understands our language
 gentlemen i quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown
what the hell are you talking about kaufman
id like to hear that data kaufman
we have word that the soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on gardiners background so far they havent come up with a thing  whats more as a result of their eagerness one of their ablest agents blew his cover we have him in custody at this time
but we are quite certain comrade that this man gardiner is a leading member of an american elitist faction planning a coup detat
that is correct comrade skrapinov we have ascertained that gardiner heads a bigbusiness power group that will soon be taking over the american government
ben
well ben i
 there is no longer any margin for inflation it has gone as far as it can youve reached your limits on taxation dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis and from where i see it mr president the free enterprise system has reached the breaking point we are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible

tell me  where is this rue de thbes
all right see you tomorrow corbiere
bah for that matter algeria isnt the only country in the world 
what is she saying
yeah  i hear they had em a real dog and pony show going on up there    ill tell you sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me  i mean did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that
i would have missed it  but the phone rang and i let it play while i talked  it looks like blank tape  but it isnt  its been erased without any input signal coming in
charlie  are you going to make a point soon
under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing  since rebecca lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will if she is found guilty the will is void and joanne braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated
an inquiry into what
because he wasnt dead when she left and even if he was not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isnt a crime
doctor mccurdy what was the cause of death
what induced it
so mr marsh used cocaine
mrs crawford you were mr marshs maid for nine years
objection sustained
cmon  think about it  if she was going to kill marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find
suspicions maybe  but suspicions arent enough for a conviction
i dont buy it and neither will a jury
your honor i fail to see what mrs crawfords educational background has to do with this case
objection your honor  the fact that mrs crawford heard mr troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesnt mean the incident never happened
objection  mr rostons sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial
objection  may i remind mr dulaney that the person on trial here is miss lawson  not dr paley
miss lawson do you use cocaine
were you aware of mr marshs heart condition
did you see mr marsh the day before his death
did you talk about miss lawson
she was here
doctor trammel when did you first diagnose that mr marsh had heart disease
how long were you together
she told me that tonight we were going to open new doors  i asked her to stop  to take off the handcuffs but she wouldnt listen
mr roston i know this is difficult for you but its important you tell the court what she did
why
isnt it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on miss lawson in the parking lot
im sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked
dr trammel did you ever speak to miss lawson about mr marshs condition
what did you prescribe for her
how do you instruct your patients to take it
did you go to college mrs crawford
i heard him say it
where did you meet him
what was the nature of your relationship with dr paley
 and what did dr paley do after you stopped seeing him
what happened next
how do you know it was cocaine that miss lawson had in the bathroom
i suppose
i dont know  im not sure
no
and that he changed his will
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money  that must have made you pretty angry
yes
three fifteen
how
can we get out of here
why not
im the photographer
yes  she did
yeah
you lied to me
no i dont have to believe you  the jury has to believe you and answers like hes lying or shes mistaken arent going to convince them
i called you all weekend  where were you
im sure youll be able to handle him
dont worry about paley  he cant touch me  no one can  ive thought it all out
what are you going you doing
rebecca  we shattered a mans life in open court
you dont need anybody
so sue me  things have changed  i think you should go home  and after you leave i see no reason for us to ever have contact again
i love you
but your honor
objection  the witness has already stated that miss lawson left without an explanation
your honor  the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons mr marsh died how it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance
cant it wait
hello hi raymond what well i was sort of planning on alright okay goodbye  that was sattler  he thinks the das going to file on rebecca lawson  he wants me in the office tomorrow morning
i swear  the both of you  some example you set
is that alright frank
working  charlie and i were going over some statements
youre sleeping with her arent you
dont use language like that at the dinner table
i didnt know that andrew was dead until mr sattler called me at home that night
well thats a long time
i dont mind waiting
i am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what ive done
i do not need instructions from you to bathe  i knew youd do this i knew id come all the way here and be shut out as usual i came to be here for you i didnt have to come  lord knows i was never much welcome in this house before apparently dead or alive nothings changed
carolyn  you want these candlesticks
explain to me again why we didnt do this in des moines in an air conditioned office
i thought everything was arranged
whats he saying now
dont say that
i cant believe shes making jokes
he remarried apparently they were having an affair for years apparently the first mrs delaney was a bit of a stiff
not officially her and steve kendall were pinned at birth but i was crazy about her and for about three months i managed to catch her during her exploring stage
everything was during betty god we were so young why did we think we had to do it all so fast ive never cheated on betty not once we were married i mean
mrs delaney  did you hear the latest
see money dont buy happiness i must say shes taking it well
shes changed
madge
no leave it ill do it later listen maybe you and floyd can come for dinner on saturday im sure richardll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all
well youre pretty close its only about two miles from here
uh uh  umm long time
this wont take long im shooting tomorrow morning i just need to do some prep work
italy to iowa id call that a change
help cook
then what happened
making pictures i like that you really love what you do dont you
you drink bug repellent
you must get lonely at times
why doesnt it scare you
do you ever regret not having a family
my mistake i apologize
listen im sorry i 
francesca
im sorry i didnt call sooner but i just read your note i stuffed it into my pocket the light was fading and i had to get my shot
ill pick you up
yes
i just feel like im getting a little  out of control thats all its kind of frightening
on that one is beautiful look at their expressions as if the camera werent on them at all as if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling
uhhuh and
good more coffee  robert i hope you dont mind my asking but i feel like i should
routine i dont have a routine and if you think thats what this is 
i was honest with you i told you who i was
how do you know what i experience
because i cant have you
no matter how i keep turning it around in my mind  it doesnt seem like the right thing
for anyone theyll never be able to live through the talk richard will never be able to he doesnt deserve that he hasnt hurt anyone in his life
no matter how much distance we put between us and this house i bring with it with me and ill feel it every minute were together and ill blame loving you for how much it hurts and then even these four days wont be anything more than something sordid and a mistake
robert please  you dont understand  no one does when a woman makes the choice to marry to have children  in one way her life begins but in another way it stops you build a life of details you become a mother a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move and when they leave they take your life of details with them and then youre expected move again only you dont remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long not even yourself you never in your life think that love like this can happen to you
what about your husband
well it was notarized and witnessed by a mrs lucy delaney maybe you can ask her
outta my way boy  cinnabar  im coming

five hours  we both just know  do you think i deserve to wear white
i believe in the soul the cock the pussy the small of a womans back the hanging curve ball high fiber good scotch long foreplay show tunes and that the novels of thomas pynchon are selfindulgent overrated crap  i believe that lee harvey oswald acted alone i believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astroturf and the designated hitter i believe in the sweet spot voting every election soft core pornography chocolate chip cookies opening your presents on christmas morning rather than christmas eve and i believe in long slow deep soft wet kisses that last for 7 days

and hes right  a ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak they dont happen very often  you know how hard this game is if you believe youre playing well because youre getting laid or because youre not getting laid or because you wore red silk pantiesthen you are  and i still think thomas pynchon is full of shit

so whatd they say
no salvatore youd better go its my father
but ive never forgotten you elena
oh how i looked for you elena youll never know i wrote telephoned nothing nobody ever answered but i dreamt of you for years thats why i went awayand never came back here  even as the years passed in all the women i met i was only looking for you i had success its true but there was always something missing  id never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me a crazy lunatic 
no salvatorethere is no future theres only the past even meeting last night was nothing but a dream a beautiful dream  we never did it when we were kids remember  now that its happened i dont think there could have been a better ending 
ive been looking for you all day did you buy the milk
noits nothing to do with you its just that i was scared of coming back now after all these years i thought i was strong that i had forgotten lots of things instead i find its quite the opposite as if i had never left and yet i look at lia and feel as if i didnt know her and you mammai abandoned you ran away like a thief thought only of myself and never gave you an explanation
don ciccio ive got an ideayou remember that old abandoned movie house where theyre supposed to build those lowrent houses
but why do you call me mr di vita it didnt used to be that way
but please mr kane dont buy any more paintings  nine venuses already we got twentysix virgins  two whole warehouses full of stuff 
ask them to sit down mr bernstein
so then tonight we go over everything thoroughly eh  especially the new papers 
yes very  naturally
susie  i called her myself the day after he died  i thought maybe somebody ought to  she couldnt even come to the phone
he finished it  he wrote the worst notice i ever read about the girl he loved  we ran it in every paper
it ended   then there was susie  that ended too  i guess he didnt make her very happy   you know i was thinking  that rosebud youre trying to find out about 
you dont say  why i had no idea 
sixtytwo thousand 
well hell be coming back in september the majestic  i got the reservations it gets in on the ninth
if you hadnt come along and protected me when you did id have killed them fellows
my little sanctum is at your disposal but i dont think i understand 
im not criticizing mr carter but heres what i mean  theres a front page story in the chronicle  and a picture  of a woman in brooklyn who is missing  probably murdered  a mrs harry silverstone  why didnt the enquirer have that this morning
im still hungry brad  lets go to rectors and get something decent  the chronicle has a twocolumn headline mr carter  why havent we
the chronicle doesnt say shes murdered mr carter  it says the neighbors are getting suspicious
but mr kane 
the nurse has complete instructions but if you care to talk to me at any time i should be only too glad   i shall be here in the morning
im sure thats it 
not at all  id like the nurse to be here too
maybe you can do it and maybe you cant mr kane
i know that emily 
what do you expect me to do  what in the world 
whats this all about emily  ive had a very tiring day and 
i intend to find out
oh yes there is
charles if you dont listen to reason it may be too late 
i cant tell you the things he said charlie  you havent got any idea 
ow
youve got some on your face
hey you should be more careful thats my ma and pa
who am i  well lets see  charles foster kane was born in new salem colorado in eighteen six   i run a couple of newspapers  how about you
i didnt think you did  if you had i wouldnt have asked you again because id have remembered how old
its not a habit  i do it because i like it
im not just your wife im a person all by myself  or i ought to be  i was once  sometimes you get me to believing i never was
dont you realize that everybody here is going to know about this that youve packed your bags and ordered the car and 
she doesnt know mrs kane  she just sent it  because i made her see it wouldnt be smart for her not to send it
i know the facts mr kane  and i happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean  youre a man of great talents mr kane
impossible  impossible
is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper
close the door raymond
do you like poetry raymond
tired
the chronicle is a good newspaper
well gentlemen are we going to war
you start tomorrow night  richard carl in the spring chicken  ill get us some girls  you get tickets  a drama critic gets them free you know  rectors at seven
oil belonging to the people of the united states was leased out for a song to a gang of highpressure crooks   nobody can blame me because 
there are the people of the united states and they are blaming you  oh i know it doesnt make any sense but at least you can learn a lesson from it
what
first of all i will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the enquirer
all right
you still want to be transferred to the other paper
well youve been getting a pretty low salary here in new york  it seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our chicago paper should get what hes worth 
it does seem too good to be true doesnt it mr bernstein
its going to be done exactly the way ive told mr thatcher 
well lets hope its all for the best
youre going to live with mr thatcher from now on charlie  youre going to be rich  your ma figures  that is er  she and i have decided that this isnt the place for you to grow up in youll probably be the richest man in america someday and you ought to 
sorry mr thatcher  what the kid needs is a good thrashing
whats this
i guess maybe im not as hard to see through as i think  anyway i never even answered his letter maybe i should have  i guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years  he hadnt finished it when she left him  he never finished it  he never finished anything  of course he built it for her 
i dont know  he was disappointed in the world  so he built one of his own   an absolute monarchy   it was something bigger than an opera house anyway   nurse  say ill tell you one thing you can do for me young fellow
yeah all in crates
what do you think all that is worth mr thompson
the banks are out of luck eh
how do you want to handle the whole thing  ask questions
i did a lot of singing after that i sang for charlie   i sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour  the teachers got that i didnt 
in case youve never heard of how i lost all my money  and it was plenty believe me

im giving him his ring back
i dont want to marry him i dont want to get married now im on the verge of graduation i want to go to grad school after this and then i want to start a career i dont want to be a wife first and then have to worry about when im going to fit in all of the other stuff  ive come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife and i know thats what id become sangs already signed with a major firm and hes going to be pulling a huge salary which would give me no reason to work and hes so traditional anyway
you dont have anything to do with it
im sure sang andveronicawould like that

equitation
on july 8 1979 security forces under control of the trilateral commission abducted the fathers of all american nobel prize winners the men many of them octogenarians were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles  the sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the rand corporation in santa monica california
holden caulfield  ucatcher in theu uryeu
you have ten copies of the book but you dont know who the main character is
you gave me an hour now give me a day
i didnt mean for you to see it its like looking in someones diary and taking it out of context  know what i mean
so whats the question
you run with your back to the picture  like you were trying to get away  once in awhile you sing along with music but mostly you punish yourself
elaborate on they okay
and you think group one is at war with group two
sure one of the richest men in america until he died a few days ago
yeah  would you i mean could you love me then  if i was normal  maybe
yesterday you were wondering about the wall  how it was possible

you made your decision yet
so he thinks nasa is plotting to kill the president
and you have no idea where he lives
jerrys visits to your office why do you tolerate them  why him
what im about to tell you is partially documented  the freedom of information act saw to that but much more of it isnt  for reasons which will soon be regrettably clear im going to share  secrets  with you repeat any of it and youll simply bestow the title of paranoid upon yourself
we experimented with hallucinogens  we used electro shock to produce a vegetative state  we conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation
me  i was a minor missionary a heretic really  but where else could a redblooded american boy lie cheat steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the allhighs  besides now im trying to pay my penance
these things youre talking about you did them to jerry
in jerrys safety deposit box
hmm how about tomorrow night
federal bureau of investigation
yes
dr jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate  why is that
guys a cia shrink  here to id fletcher  they knew each other somehow
youre welcome  spooks  so you want to compare notes on this guy
jonas
can i talk to you a second
do you believe me
no idea  honest  what are you going to do
what
theres no plug to pull
 or youre our kind of people 
and only two probabilities  one there is intelligent life in the universe but theyre so far away youll never contact it in your lifetime 
ellie
no youre not  but the price has just gotten too high
then why havent you detected any signals  if as you claim there have been thousands millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasnt one signal gotten through  itll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through youre welcome to stay until then
 arrangements also have to be made for the vips coming in mostly religious leaders
they knew our level of development if as you say theyve done this many times theyd be well aware of the implications
you arent staying
nothing  i guess i just wanted to thank you
what does it say
dr lunacharsky
theres no way of knowing  without a key  a primer to help us maybe never
i dont have the figures in front of me but yes that sounds about right
please answer the question doctor
talk to him
youre not real  none of this is
so  are you an hallucination  or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin
so we passed some kind of test
no  i mean why so soon
that isnt the way it works
no more stalling captain
sr hadden  you compromised our security codes
you live here
mr hadden im a scientist i dont make deals but  if you wish to give me in good faith access to your information i can assure you that i will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesnt conflict with the best interests of science or my better judgment
whats that
it looks like pixie dust  kent wouldve given anything to see this  david too
what are you talking about  its over
as each component was tested and shipped off to texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in hokkaido  for backup purposes of course weve been right behind you the entire time  you see my problem  i couldnt appear to control too large a percentage my enemies wouldnt stand for it  so i simply made sure the japanese consortium received the systems integration contract  of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired whollyowned subsidiaries 
i read your paper on etis  its brilliant
its like the precopernicans who swore the sun revolved around the earth or the victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made  i mean try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us  then imagine trying to explain i dunno a microwave oven  to someone even a hundred years ago  i mean the basic concepts didnt exist
 i keep telling myself okay thats just the price you have to do your time doing shitwork before youre allowed to get to the good stuff but if i have to catalog one more quasar  god ive missed you
the vla
we could be together again 
but what about your research  
its good to see you ellie
thank god  when we lost contact i thought  we thought but youre okay  were still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction  did you notice anything at all that 
its all right the important thing is youre safe 
champagne please
my fathers house has many mansions
i thought it was wellwritten heartfelt  and a little bit naive but thats just the enemys perspective
and yet youre willing to die for this cause the one thing thats given your life a sense of purpose dont you see the contradiction here  
during the crusades  pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show theyd actually been there  i thought it sort of made sense that earth is now your holy land so
and then what  then youll be safe
youre sure you want to  in the universe i saw were not exactly the stars of the show  what happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small
 but it is a good question and i suppose ill always wonder about the answer  why would they send me back without proof
oh my god
well  that would seem to decide it like it or not for the moment anyway it looks like were all in this together
 as have all attempts at internal analysis  weve tried sonargrams magnetic resonance gamma rays its completely impenetrable

please dont make this personal 
benes natural defenses white corpuscles  antibodies once you begin to grow  and become a menace to the body  youll trigger them off michaels with all the unknown factors in the body i still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider

a surgeon might
looks like the molecular structure of proteins
but that isnt possible
removal point whatre you talking about
only to the naked eye  those corpuscles  carrying oxygen  give the stream its color but the rest of the plasmas very much like sea water an ocean of life
isnt there another surgical procedure you can try
there it is
at this size i would certainly think so
well sir which is it the wireless or benes life

i  i dont know what to say i know hes under a cloud but theres not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession

thats good  get all your tears out now youll need your eyes  for the signs
i didnt beat it i hid from it if you were smart youd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog because what little life you have left is over as you know it  dont make new friends dont fall in love and dont ever bother trying to save others  thats the worst killer of them all

without grendel knowing about it bingo and bingo was his nameo counterfeit cds  tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy the sound qualitys better and sos the money
after their initial investment in the factory grendel didnt need them  told them to fuck off they tried to get these cds together in order to have proof of grendels involvement so they could keep him in line  nows the fun part
a simple please would suffice

kay
hows the baby

why too late
on a plane back to sicily
kay i told you
if thats what it takes then yes i will
you missed my point you are no longer an owner
its michael  how are you mom
what a mistake people behaving like that with guns  it was my understanding we left all that behind  but let me tell you the important thing is that youre all right  good health is the most important thing more than success more than power more than money
its always bad for business but you have no choice
this doubles my investment
youre a careful kid and thats good  but look  an international dispatch on the wire service american journalism not propaganda the government troops have all but eliminated the rebels  all but their radio station

i just left our friend in miami
the hotels registered owners are one jacob lawrence and sidney barclay both beverly hills attorneys  in reality its split between the old lakeville road group from cleveland and our friend in miami  he takes care of others outside the country you know who i mean  meyer klingman runs the store and does all right but ive been instructed to tell you that if you move him out our friend in miami will go along with you
is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the five families in new york to assume and consolidate your nefarious power
mr corleone do you have any hotel interests in the state of arizona or any gambling interests in that state
do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of new york
says who
you give your loyalty to a jew over your own blood
i want you to help me take my revenge
trust me do as i ask
the corleone family controls two major hotels in vegas one in reno the licenses were grandfathered in so you had no difficulties with the gaming commission  but i have the idea from sources  that youre planning to move in on the tropicana  in another week or so youll move klingman out which leaves you with only one technicality  the license which is now in klingmans name
he dont want to talk
we could have talked first saved a lot of running around
you know if theres a way ill go to the commission and the commission will side with me  that puts me and the other new york families against you
he supports me
whats this
ive already rented it i cannot disappoint the new tenants  theyre paying a higher rent
your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me and i want to show that i too have some christian charity  her rent will remain what it was
these old movies are such a hoot they thought they were being scary but theyre just funny

my teacher told me once theres a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it even after youre dead so that when you die youre trapped inside your body watching it corrode for all eternity
it was an analogy your soul is locked up inside you you need to free it trevor youve blocked it from the healing process thats what we need to do now heal your soul and to do that i you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt do you know what i mean by giving in its about trust do you trust me implicitly

lava
this is singlewall construction its just a shack
a statistical phenomenon  says everything in the world goes in streaks  its real you see it everywhere  in weather in river flooding in baseball in blackjack in stock markets  once things go bad they tend to stay bad  bad things cluster  they go to hell together
yes  and people will live in the absence of truth
you remember that guy about twenty years ago i forget his name but he climbed everest without any oxygen came down almost dead  and they asked him why did you go up there to die  and he said i didnt  i went up there to live
you know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation but you didnt bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in you dont have the faintest idea whats going on on this island
youre going home  im sending a radio call for the boats  well all go down to the lagoon and wait for them

that storm center hasnt dissipated or changed course were going to have to cut the tour short im afraid pick it up again tomorrow where we left off
fences are failing all over the park  a few minor systems he said
  shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did if i understand correctly all the system will come back on their original startup modes correct
are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours i mean whats hanging us up
the lysine contingency  its intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island but we could use it now  dr wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism animals cant manufacture the amino acid lysine  unless theyre continually supplied with lysine by us theyll go into a coma and die
imbalance disorientation labored breathing  seems to happen about every six weeks or so
yes mitotic pupils should be constricted
yes  we know theyre toxic but the animals dont eat them
pretty sure
well not one of those well yeah a possibly one at some point could be a good thing  whats so wrong with kids
oh my god they do not  they dont smell
alright the one on the airplane had an accident but usually babies dont smell
ellie we can tear up the rule book on coldbloodedness it doesnt apply theyre totally wrong  this is a warmblooded creature  theyre totally wrong

ellie com one
dr grant

thats right  will break through
i know its very exciting
alan listen to this
unpredictability
alan

hey  where did you find those things
have a heart gentlemen  their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion
and his book was a lot fatter than yours
a doyouthinkhesaurus what do you call a blind dinosaurs dog
come on try some  take a bite
so you two dig up dinosaurs
cloning from what  loy extraction has never recreated an intact dna strand
to grant shes uh   tenacious
whatd i touch
their radios out too  gennaro said to stay put
whats to be scared about  its just a little hiccup in the power
where does he think hes going
and who in gods name do you think you are
not just kids   for everyone  were going to open next year  unless the lawyers kill me first  i dont care for lawyers  you
that things got a what twentyfive twentyseven foot neck
  and youre going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirtyfoot neck without a fourchambered heart and get around like that  like that  this is like a knockout punch for warmbloodedness
tim  lex
hes knocked out  hes knocked out  dr grant  dr grant  daddy daddy
all night
i like cows
whats that
lets go
what works
dont do that
i think perhaps ill just sit down  i dont suppose you think all that much of me now do you
why didnt i build in orlando
whats going to happen to the goat  hes going to eat the goat
im sorry   im sorry  
i dont think the people who live around here would like that very much
thats not true
jesus christ
hello
other guy
what
whats going on
are you going to plead insanity
zombie sluts from beyond the grave
he wets the bed
oh
i dont believe it jasons mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969
dont get me wrong i dont care but the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do
what do you want  a tidy psychological profile you want to hear that i was falsely accused of a crime i didnt commit and thats driven me to defend others or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings talk about my childhood
not much here jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia thats about it
its rare but there are cases where people go for years without sleep  they diagnosed jason with simple insomnia but thats not what it looks like to me he has every indication of having insomnolesence
theres nothing to see here he sleeps we record it thats all that happens
see this
if im right this happened before the krueger murders in springwood  that means that jason mightve been kruegers first victim
great now theres two serial killers on the loose
kruegers in the real world maybe hes mortal like us
so you think it might counteract kruegers ability to make us hallucinate
are you all right
have you worked here long
i read the one about the penal colony
gabriela was right  its easier for me to understand suicide im a practicing suicide
 im flattered of course to be considered a friend  even without knowing all the details   to see such determination is reward enough for me
a true friend would do it
you didnt give it to umeu
youve been with the firm for nearly nine years  youve done your work diligently there are no complaints on that score  but theres more to the job than the work  there are other people to consider  and frankly kafka we eel your social situation could bear improving
well  nice to know life exists outside the office
he would have  you were his best friend  a better friend than me
what
how long were you and eduard 
ah  were back to the authorities you spoke of
i nominated you as a possible candidate  you were eduards good friend  he read me some of your work
and you still maintain  what that he was murdered
burgel  i didnt leave it with him
theyre not obliged to tell
you might think  i thought so myself at first  that burgels too insignificant to be dangerous but thats the very reason to beware its the small men to watch out for  the ones who substitute method for character
how often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records
or what if there really uwasu an error  i dont know what kind  any kind that needed correcting  and what if burgel was responsible for it  one mistake  even a small one in a firm like ours  it could cost him a promotion
gabriela  you did get away
gabriela 
only two steps back  even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that
i know how they reward failure if they saw this id be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon  with all the others
i think youve just escaped for the moment  just as i did  as eduard did  as they let us do but only for the moment
kafka  is that your real name
where youve been employed for seven years
would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close
but thats just my point  she was more than upset she was livid she slammed every door on her way downstairs  except that one  i was just behind her and i didnt even hear that one ushutu  not at all
you told me to contact you if anything relevant came up  gabriela is relevant  when i spoke to you before i didnt know shed been seeing eduard
do you
i didnt realize youd been here that long
still were probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings
thats umadu
the fact that its live bodies you practice your trade on doesnt seem to matter to you
 and the new patients they bring me arent usually as dexterous as youve been in evading us  not perfect specimens by any means but not the type of person wholl be missed either
raban  thatll be nearly at the back of the alphabet
its gone out so quickly

when is mommy coming back
yeah
thats not the right soap  we use the kind in the green and yellow box
you get a new fence
i want mymmommyi want mmmymommy
is mom ever coming back
i dont think so
objection
see  thats my name
what did you do when you were little
billy sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced theres a discussion about who the child should live with the mother or the father  now there is a man who is very wise  hes called a judge  and a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with
becausewell thats what he does  hes a very powerful man
bigger than a principal  the judge sits in robes in a big chair the judge has thought a lot about us about you and me and your mom and he has decided  he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom joanna in her apartment  and im very lucky  because even though youll live with your mom joanna ill get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month
objection
sustained
i see  well youll have to do better than that  do you have any affidavits to support negligence
and would you describe those years as happy
did you wish to
yeslook during the last five years we were married i hadi was getting more and moreunhappy more and more frustrated  i needed to talk to somebody  i needed to find out if it was me if i was going crazy or what  but every time i turned to tedmy exhusband he couldnt handle it  he became veryi dont know very threatened  i mean when ever i would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack  anyway we became more and more separate more and more isolated from one another  finally i had no other choice i had to leave and because of my exhusbands attitudehis unwillingness to deal with my feelings i had come to have almost no self esteem  at the time i left i sincerely believed that there was something wrong with methat my son would be better off without me  it was only when i got to california and started into therapy i began to realize i wasnt a terrible person  and that just because i needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child that didnt make me unfit to be a mother
and did you have a close personal relationship
mr kramer nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their christmas bonus
there might be something at j walter thompson  but  i dont think theyre really serious  the positions been open for two months and  they may just be on a fishing expedition  im sure youll be much happier if you wait until after the first
i dont recall
somewhere in between
whom youve seen twice in a year mrs kramer your exhusband wasnt he the longest personal relationship in your life
i was not a failure
i consider it less my failure than his
were you
i am not  im a terrible mother im an awful mother  i yell at him all the time  i have no patience  nono  hes better off without me  ted ive got to goive got to go
hows the new job
tedthe reason i wanted to see youi want billy back
ted listen to meyou and i we had a really crappy marriage  look dont get so defensive okay  it was probably as much my fault as it was yours anyway when i left i was really screwed up
ted all my life id either been somebodys daughter or somebodys wife or somebody elses mother then all of a sudden i was a thirtytwoyearold highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child  i went to california because that was about as far away as i could get  only i guess it wasnt far enough so i started going to a shrink  ted ive had time to think ive been through some changes ive learned a lot about myself
im sorryi just mentioned it in passing  i never thought hed use it
please ted  i never would have brought it up if i thought
only can i still see him
ted will you take it easy revlons not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this without making us sweat  now just relax okay everythings gonna be fine
oconnors out to get you  hes going to take the fire and ice account away from you
and
thats if we win  if we lose you could end up having to pay your wifes court costs as well
look ted i dont honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him
jesus christ  did you have to be so rough on her
mr kramer would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child
how often do you see mr kramer and his son
can you describe the relationship between mr kramer and his son
what  she wants what
things what kind of things
two  she is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it  thelma do you know where i could be in this business if i had a wife that entertained or went out socially
i mean what are you going to do about billy
look this is nothing personal but i dont think you can do it
ive got enough trouble raising my own kid  i dont need another one  got it
california
she ever ask about me
ted

he is dead  by gods choice  there is nothing to discuss
louis please  
dartagnan you will hunt down aramis porthos and athos and bring me their heads or i will have yours  and as for you phillippe back to the prison you shall go and into the mask you hate
if i find out the identity of this jesuit rebel  i will kill both him and the man who told me
i grow closer to my target your majesty
dartagnan arrest them all
what do you propose to do
it can  i know the way
the prison of belle sur
you are not my priest aramis  you would not be even if i had one
he who is not with us is against us
switch  that is your plan  it is ludicrous
it is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours  it is phillippes as well
hang himself
but 
aramis this will never 
then to the bastille
look at us  we are old men now  but once we were young  and when we saw injustice we fought it
i cannot betray louis  i will defend him with my life
once you are through dont stop until you reach the river
dartagnan those are young musketeers down there  they have been weaned on our legends  they revere us  it is an advantage why dont we charge them
mother of god
but why
but what if something extraordinary happened  something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else  someone whose confirmation of phillippe the king would never be questioned
he gets one day of confession each year  today is the day
phillippe has been removed to the bastille to the lower dungeon  at midnight tonight i will order the guard changed and will delay the replacements for ten minutes  that should give you ample time  never have i needed more to say  one for all and all for one  dartagnan
but  are you sure
they must stay sharp  there was an attempt on the kings life today
raoul is hurrying to the front so i must hurry too
athos please
if you ever loved me  if you ever loved honor or anything else  then stand now and let it happen
all this time i was a lost secret  but you were hiding all your loyalty all your love  you were the man in the iron mask
this place i once lived in a country house  i had guardians  an old man and woman  and tutors but no friends  then when i was twelve they came and took me to the prison
aaa  dartagnan  these passages were constructed for the kings security not so you could step from my fathers portrait and startle me to death
a personal nature
betrothed  i think not
continue
 the ball continue
what number on the first page

riots  my people live in the worlds most beautiful city their king has the grandest palaces on earth  why should they feel anything but pride and contentment

ive known from the very first book that misery had to be born of nobility and i was right
oh paul can i read each chapter when you finish i can fill in the ns  will she be her old self now that ian has dug her out or will she have amnesia
will she still love him with that special perfect love
i hope you like it
well it certainly says you
paul this is positively the best misery youve ever written
paul my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south
it was windthorne i knew itwhat does that do to her love for ian  of course if she hadnt thought windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with ian in the first place  sorry its just that this is so wonderful
you really think sheldons out there

well 
well shes got a point
we were in the nick of time  you were in great peril
you were sir galahad you were in terrible peril
hurry
i done it again
so what did ponsonby do when she started shouting
how much
sixty
its only grief makes her like she is
she loved him
aye but will they
shell blow hot and cold on you john she always does  you want to be careful
and she sent no word down
wont you give yourself a rest john shes other people to look out for her
good  shes a good girl  arent you yeah shes a lovely girl  and you know the queens riding tomorrow
my concern is for the reputation of the monarchy
what did you say
yes but isnt midnight a little excessive
then well have to see what can be arranged
there is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the equerries  no plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household
awaiting my orders
if i find out that you had anything to do with this i will have you sacked
dont think i cant persuade her
do you hunt
always remember you keep it tight to your shoulder you absorb the kick aim for the head  then imagine its gladstone
forgive me ive called you out and you should have been resting
youre injured
still someone must attend you  your wife should not have let you out
then i envy yo
your family sent cards  it was much appreciated
yes  you have a brother in service here do you not  i forget his name
the queen will ride out if and when she chooses
those over there there
sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming
he has been attending at balmoral for many years
aye well if all you want is a good opinion then hed be sure to oblige you
theyre ready now
the threat from the irish is greatly exaggerated im sure
has someone seen to those bruises
maam
i had foreseen that you would not but your majesty should understand  that my mind will not be changed in this  i leave for deeside 
 you stand there and tell me it is my duty  after all you promised me
forgive me gentlemen  im late
i came as quickly as i could
gossip counts  lord aberdeen was right  this country is not governed by wisdom but by talk  granted it wouldnt take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning but if public opinion is against her then it doesnt do to appear too close
erysipelas
he appears to be  standing by his horse
how long has he been this sick
sir henry mr brown is standing in the courtyard  i have no wish to go riding
who told them that
noone should think themselves wiser than me  it is not for any of the queens subjects to presume to tell her majesty when and where she should come out of mourning  it is the queens sorrow that keeps her secluded  it is her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility work which she feels will soon wear her out entirely
from princess helena and other members of your family
then why are you not with him
were having some problems with arcade
but how can it change every time
so take his car home  wait  im sure hes up to something
i have to talk to you
what do you mean by weird
no wait  just listen  i hooked it up earlier tonight and it said my name  as soon as i turned it on nick  it said my name  how could it know  and then i asked it where greg was and it said in here
see men always do this  quiet down honey  chill out  take a valium im not a fucking idiot nick  i did not imagine it
sorry  maybe i need the valium
we have to find out whats happened to them i think theyre gone
well
where do we go
its not just the cable system  its in the phone system as well the electronic net  its everywhere
ive been thinking about that  arcades like a virus so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started  you know like his point of origin
okay  give us a kiss
ill take the lead and handle the physical threats  you watch the elapsed time and look for exits
okay  its west
and weve still got time left  this was a piece of cake
our times up
what the fuck is that
come on  well hit dantes after school try the game out maybe get some dinner
then well go home
which way
think  i want to go to the city of truth and the truth teller is from therebut which one is which  the liarthink
i love you alex  i never wanted to leave you know that dont you
a man after my own heart  straight to the point  whats different about arcade is the way it reacts  it responds like a human does  it learns  it adapts each time you play it changes its strategy
so whats the scenario  am i saving a princess  fighting zombies
but im not broke
youd better fix this ray
howdy
well just stop for a little second and think about it will ya do that for me

then i began to listen to what the welloff were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended and the language was much the same as it had been before the first reform act  a small minority thought that england was really theirs they had made it they owned it  the rest the wage earners were foreigners outsiders intent on wrecking it all
give them here  this tells you how the womens peace camp came to be set up  all local women at first then we had support from women and men all over the country

what did you think of that wadja film
good theory  but i like my mother i have no aversions to what she does
no theres a fourth  numbness you do everything right but you feel nothing either way
mummy and i we were more like lovers really or sisters  then a couple of years after daddy died and not long after i left oxford she started seeing various men and i was furious  i really was upset i stopped going home  i never phoned  i went round telling everyone how awful her books were and she hardly seemed to notice and that made me angrier  then i got a job i was interested in and i started to see lots of men and i suppose i grew up a little and began to understand  so i wrote her a long letter almost seven pages saying how sorry i was and how i was worried that we were drifting apart  and do you know she wrote me a poem a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters
in radio were different
i havent seen much of you
might
shall we have a drink or something
to the airlift
cmon  i dont want any jones about this

the blood transfusion continues marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp so that he can see nikolas in bright light while he himself sits in the dark nikolas watches lones face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death life slowly seems to return to her and her breathing becomes more peaceful she opens her eyes and looks at the people round her but she is much too enfeebled to speak and closes her eyes again marc keeps a close watch on nikolas who grows paler and paler his eyes swivel slowly from nikolas to the patient and back to nikolas again
you killed him  come on with the rest of it you killed him
but you were in on it  you worked for him
yes why
he can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough  plenty of dough
you wouldnt get mixed up with that little rotter would you
but why shes the best friend ive got
nonsense shes one of the nicest girls i know
i wont let you say that
are we going to have the same quarrel over again
you wouldnt have said that before you met her
although you would be amused if i were to tell you that i knew you before you were born before this terrible thing happened to me    i made a very beautiful statue even if i had not met with this disaster i could never have hoped to do anything finer probably nothing quite so fine and my child you are that figure come to life i wonder some time would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work
no  i  wanted to speak to ralph we had a silly argument last night and i said something unkind
but it was really my fault

im through clowning youre all washed up get out

well what do you think im in this for  think of it man a match  a cigar stub  and ten thousand pounds to divide between us
if my curiosity is not too great would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing
and he isnt struck dead this man he lives it would be interesting to know young man where and when you studied anatomy
i wouldnt feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight mr igor the weather was against you and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow
have you got it is it completed
id be glad to mr igor  i think ill have somethin to tell you soon
what are you laughing at
id know him anywhere
im glad they didnt hold you downtown
what was her name
ive been dreaming about you
no  i didnt   im listening
why
she must have gone out for a walk with the children
i am in awe of it mother
oh mother not the castor oil
rose who were those scoundrels in birmingham
was that what they tried to do was that why daddy gave you the job to save you from those scoundrels
promise not to tell doll  or nobody buddy its your daddy im so much in love with him i am out of my mind
well i thought they were more like a cantaloupe
well are you satisfied now can we just lie and talk huh
dont mention it
you better quit that
no no youre not hurting me  but i think you better quit it
buddy you wouldnt tell nobody would you
hes got doubts about hisself and thats the saddest thing of all would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him
yep we had em in orange crates all over it was daddys dream he was goin to get rich raisin rabbits it was what killed daddy he didnt drown hisself till a long time later after momma and lunette died of typhoid but it was them rabbits what killed him
boy did i get sick of rabbit but later on after momma died and daddy wasnt doin nothin but drinkin i sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew you know i oughtnt to of told you about what daddy done when i was a child until them rabbits ruined him he was a real good man buddy
yeah i know
of course not
you were up late last night brother
well well what i mean is you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him but look this brother it is even more interesting look at this mark here and that mark over there now wouldnt you say those marks are the marks of a ladder
see son the paint is flaked off here freshly look at it brother there is no question about it some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder
excuse me gotta go to bathroom
now i cant see what are they doing
so am i
well you rascal whered you come from
about as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave good to see you son  did you bring any of that yankee whisky with you
he didnt lose her he threw her away
you know i dont know this town any more all this traffic new buildings prosperity  where have the years gone daddy where is the little town i knew as a boy
all right daddy we have our drink were out on the patio you have prepared me for it roses cancer has come back hasnt it
dead rose is dead you mean she died
whats the matter hon is anything wrong
i wish you wouldnt pick on rose and tease her like that of course her clothes are silly but shes ignorant naive she doesnt know any better
well shes back
that sulky boy was here again this afternoon i was almost scared he wouldnt go away
 i am not responsible for her epizootics and i did not bring about her epizootics now listen to me when i have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes 
im sorry darlin i hate it as much as you do
if you mean sex you couldnt be more wrong rose likes those boys and men she has love in her heart and that is what they want its the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her
rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed  i hope shell be all right but i still think we ought to fire her
her plan is obvious plain as day shes going on a hunger strike the question is how do we foil her
it sounds like a farm to me calling it a dairy establishment thats just trickery and flummery
youre not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning the problem is what are we going to do
i thought i knew you i thought i knew you better i thought in your heart you were a good and kind man well i cant believe what ive just heard in this room a defenseless girl depending on you for protection and you propose to mutilate and destroy her how could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man
i cant believe you really meant it if i did id want to die you arent a male monster that man is but you arent look me in the eye and tell me do you really want to take roses womanhood away from her when its all she has got
all right all right now calm down rose the children will hear you calm down lets talk about this thing lets discuss it
goddamn you girl youve made me make a fool out of myself damn your hide but let me tell you i am standing at the pass of thermopylae and i wont budge the very idea my own home with children in the house to say nothing of my wife  ohh you had better believe i am standing at thermopylae you little nut you had better believe it what are you crazy a man is supposed to be a fool like this but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense are you a nitwit whats the matter with you
why sure always got time to get you a halfacup and one of these days im gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens
thats a pretty stylish skirt rose the only thing i dont understand is how did you ever get it on
what have you got in your hair girl
well rose my sleep was a little disturbed last night and so was mrs hillyers and so was the childrens how about you was your sleep disturbed too
darlin ill take a taxi to the hotel you and brother can handle the girls epizootics ill just say one more thing  rose i told you you had a friend in mrs hillyer didnt i that she would fight for you like a tiger
good morning rose and how do you feel today
umm well yes but no more strange voices in the night rose
i didnt mean to bite him he was hitting horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and and i bit him accidental
i didnt mean to bite him i really didnt
its so mr hillyer
i dont mean that the way it sounds  imagine it a book and i used to know you personal way back when  tell me something buddy how do you dream up all that stuff
well no i didnt actually
i dont want to start no fight with you buddy why do you say im full of shit
i dont like that either its worse than waski i want to be called fran
whats the matter with him
of course she does and i must say im puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital i should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill
i will not cry like a woman if im upset its because of what my husband said not because of you you cant make me cry like a woman a woman has got just as much intelligence and selfcontrol as a man and you get this in your head if you hurt that girl ill hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got ill do my level best to ruin you do you understand me
i understand you perfectly you leave that girl alone you wretched man or you will be sorry
well she finally let me look in her mouth is it true shes never been to a dentist
what are you studying now mrs hillyer
well i think its charming rose  but dont you think ah the skirt is a little tight
poor thing does the ice help rose
you see rose now thats the kind of dress you ought to wear
well theres no reason you shouldnt go out rose in moderation
rose you dont look well and you havent eaten a bit of breakfast

keep away the cats thou art like one of these fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says quotgod send me no need of theequot and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer when indeed there is no need
either withdraw unto some private place or reason coldly of your grievences or else depart here all eyes gaze on us
tell me in sadness who is that you love
i aimd so near when i supposed you loved
i do spy a kind of hope which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent if rather than to marry paris thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death to chide away this shame no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest  each part deprived of supple government shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the capulet lie in the meantime against thou shalt awake shall romeo by my letters know our drift and hither shall he come and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua take thou this vial being then in bed and this distilling liquor drink thou off ill send my letters to thy lord post haste to mantua
holy saint francis what a change is here is rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken young mens love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes

then have my lips the sin that they have took
do not swear although i joy in thee i have no joy of this contract tonight it is too rash too unadvised too sudden too like the lightning which doth cease to be ere one can say it lightens sweet good night this bud of love by summers ripening breath may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet good night
by the hour of nine
come gentle night come loving blackbrowned night give me my romeo and when i shall die take him and cut him out into little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun o i have bought the mansion of love but not possessed and though i am sold not yet enjoyed o tedious is this day as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them
wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day
then window let day in and let life out o thinkst thou we shall ever meet again

there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie for instance 1 you can never have sex the minute you get a little nookie  youre as good as gone sex always equals death 2 never drink or do drugs the sin factor its an extension of number one and 3 never ever ever under any circumstances say ill be right back

im sure everyones doing their best
thank you  tell them thank you
hes being arraigned tomorrow
jesus christ man dont shoot me
what do you mean
i hate to burst your bubble but other than the fact that youre especially sadistic theres nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours
you cant see the whole the whole complete act yet  not yet  but when this is done its going to be so so
i i doubt i enjoyed it any more than detective mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows  isnt that true  how happy would it make you to hurt me with impunity
innocent  is that supposed to be funny look at the people i killed  an obese man a disgusting man who could barely stand up who if you saw him on the street youd point so your friends could mock him along with you  who if you saw him while you were eating you wouldnt be able to finish  your meal  after him i picked the lawyer  and you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one  this was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets
a woman
a woman so ugly on the inside that she couldnt bare to go on living if she couldnt be beautiful on the outside  a drug dealer a drug dealing pederast actually  and dont forget the disease spreading whore  only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face  thats the point  you see a deadly sin on almost every street corner and in every home literally  and we tolerate it because its common it seems trivial and we tolerate all day long morning noon and night  not anymore  im setting the example and its going to be puzzled over and studied and followed from now on
youre going to be remembered and its all because of me  and the only reason im here right now is because i wanted to be
youve made a good life for yourself
let me tell you how i want this to go  i want you to look and i want you to listen
not here
when we found him he was lying there with a knife in his back so what else could it be but homicide  except i finally figured out he held the knife behind him put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall then he shoved his body backwards
youve seen my files right  seen the things ive done
he ate his fill and was forced to continue eating till his body rejected the food the killer held a bucket under him and then kept serving  he took his time  the coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours  the victims throat was swollen from the effort and there was probably a point where he passed out  thats when killer kicked him in the stomach  popped him
hows that
you go to movies at least
hes preaching
the sins were used in medieval sermons there were seven cardinal virtues and then seven deadly sins created as a learning tool because they distract from true worship
what the fuck is that
oh yeah sure  you got to be kidding
just honestly have you ever seen anything like this been involved in anything like this
im sorry but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues ive seen so many corpses rolled away unrevenged
it is victor
listen to me  hes all about playing games
there must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow  i mean christ do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves
hey freud what brand of bullshit are you shoveling huh  right now hes probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommys panties singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter
for a long time the fbis been hooked into the library system keeping accurate records
youre sure youre reading that right john doe
what are you going to say
wait just wait
think about it
by the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead
no dates indicated placed on the shelves in no discernible order  its just his mind poured out on paper  i dont think its going to give us any specifics
dont try to focus on things as black and white because youll go blind  theres no winning and losing here
you tell me then you walk into an apartment and a man has beaten his wife to death or the wife murdered the husband and you have to wash the blood off their children  you put the killer in jail  who won
listen to yourself  you say the problem with people is they dont care so i dont care about people  but youre already here  youve been here a long time  so theres a part of you that knows even if everything you say is true none of it matters
put your gun down
are you absolutely certain
its nice to meet you  my husband has told me a lot about you except your first name
you have a strange way about you i mean interesting  im sorry  its really none of my business  its just nice to meet a man who talks like that  if david saw that paper hed say youre a fag  thats how he is

it is only important what you are an adulterer

 found the body this morning  you do believe now dont you
what is that you wear
listen to what you say
young masbath i am sorry for your loss  it is a great and sad tragedy however i cannot be the one to look after you now
what is the common thread between these victims
what is it
out there  what do you see

then who murdered the old crone  and why
if someone has the horsemans skull if they control the horseman then why havent they sent him for your head yet

there is no masbath here  my fathers loan papers are missing
what books
shes the one who controlled the horseman isnt she sir  sir 
why why are you like this
this is farewell
he has proposed to me twice
yes but listen  the illusion is easily explained  the eye retains each image till they combine  and yet some would call this toy magic

my god what has happened

yes sir
that boy wants me to
i done et just a little bit ago
frank dont talk that way whos that strange lookin man behind you did he follow you in here
i thought youd be happy to leave
his mother told him that he was their punishment hers and his fathers from god for having sex
its the best youre gonna get im sorry
where will he go
also melinda please dont tell anybody at the store that albert was here tonight okay
no at least i dont think i am
wow you dont fool around do you
its been a while i thought maybe youd be in touch
and what about for you
do me a favor will you
i didnt know you took pictures
so youre not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter
ive never seen anything like it
what do you mean
the kids sorry auggie
no the  uh  the bobbsey twins lit out when they heard the sirens but at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull  assaultus interruptus
you havent heard from rashid have you
two right
so are we ready
which means that she spent her last christmas with you
like what
i know what it means that still dont make it a good name
a couple of moments ill grant you that a second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity
i told her she was going to meet her father
relax okay you dont have to do anything just go in there and pretend it wont kill you to do a little favor like that besides you might even learn something
shes just a kid theres time for more babies later after she grows up
not if you got her into one of those rehab programs
no youre not
whats this
how long you been working for me auggie
yeah i know to that girl who moved to pittsburgh
speaking of which are you still going ahead with that deal on the montecristos
no thanks i dont care what you do but just make sure you dont get caught okay the last i heard it was still illegal to sell cuban cigars in this country
definitely id say youve hit the nail on the head
a little not much
itll never be finished
fiftysix  that girl had on a corset
he goes to john jay high school in brooklyn
dont put words in my mouth what im saying is she drove off in cyruss car and went to the fivespot lounge with him for a drink what im saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car he was in no shape to drive but he drove the car anyway and before he could get her back to where she lived the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed cyrus lived but he came out of it a cripple his left arm was so mangled the doctors had to cut it off small punishment for what he did if you ask me
jesus had nothing to do with it if hed been involved he would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did
i dont know what you look like boy as far as i can tell you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night  you live in this town  or on your way from here to there
not a one not one customer all day i bought this brokendown shithole of a place three weeks ago and if business dont pick up soon im going straight down the skids what do i want to be hiring someone for i cant even pay my own wages
ill tell you what you want to work ill give you a job nothing permanent mind you but that upstairs room over there   the one above the office  is a hell of a mess it looks like theyve been throwing junk in there for twenty years and its time it got cleaned up
the name is cyrus cole
i dont mean to be nosy but i was wondering what happened to your arm
thats funny his name is the same as yours
thomas
what are you talking about
people dont do that kind of thing not in new york
i didnt expect to see you again
i listen on the radio i can see the games just fine that way  the world is in your head remember
twelve thirteen years ago  actually he died with his sketch pad open on his lap up in the berkshires one weekend drawing a picture of mount greylock
time to wake up  hey kid time to wake up  rashid  up and out i have to work in here the slumber party is over
im sorry im really sorry i was trying to reach for one of the books up there   and then i dont know the sky fell on top of me
two or three nights
im sorry i messed up youve been very kind to me   but all good things have to come to an end right
thats because we dont belong anywhere you dont fit into your world and i dont fit into mine were the outcasts of the universe
thanks 
once a story gets hold of you its hard to let go  besides im making up for lost time
okay just a little hint i cant tell you the story but ill tell you what gave me the idea for it
all right listen carefully  about twentyfive years ago a young man went skiing alone in the alps there was an avalanche the snow swallowed him up and his body was never recovered
hey hey happy birthday why didnt you tell me
yes an invitation i apologize for springing it on you at the last minute but mr benjamin and i are attending a celebration tonight and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us  isnt that right mr benjamin
his only copy  i mean if you think youre going to die whats more important a good book or a good smoke and so he huffed and he puffed and little by little he smoked his book
and started to run
a lot of good it will do you if the creeper finds you
so you lost the job is that what youre telling me he just up and fired you
cuban cigars you mean he had some hankypanky going with those guys
heres what youre going to do youre going to open up your backpack take out your bag of money count out five thousand dollars and hand it over to auggie
im serious all right youve got to square it with auggie since you wont give the money back to the creeper you can use it to make things right with auggie thats probably better anyway better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies
fuck you too you white sonofabitch
yeah give him another one and ill take a cup of coffee while youre at it
ill take the iced coffee  you only live once right
how do you want that cooked
so the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all  it was uhumanu yes  type b positive
and the blood could unotu have belonged to defendant  seeing that his type is o negative
and when he came home  did he write you about this  or phone perhaps
so the fishing gaff method wouldnt make sense
you mean miyamoto followed him out there and suckerpunched him
closer to eight
we discussed that  and decided not to
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder
doesnt it seem to uyouu mrs miyamoto that your mistake was in being deceitful  concealing information during the course of a sheriffs investigation
hes still got a good grip  we need to dig more
i can just feel my spirits soar
we all expect the world to be fair as if we have some right t
i couldnt say anything  i just stood there hating her
you dont believe in god anymore
they only arrested that poor soul because hes japanese
well what then sergeant
and your evaluation of the defendant  could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff so quickly there would be no sign of struggle
as peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man and an assailant strong enough to subdue himthat leaves only a usingleu overturned ucupu in its wake
ueverythingu had to happen ujustu right  for your little story to fly  i mean a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a ulotu of reasons
your line of work  you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth
as my wife testified we were considering it
sheriff said right off i was under suspicion  i didnt have a lawyer
my apologies  do you regret not telling the truth
they got transferred that day out to cape flattery
you said three minutes
your daddy  was quite a feller
now you believe there were utwou lanterns when defendant arrived one in carls hand  the second lashed to the mast
miyamoto gave him the battery and left  carls boat was running he goes back to fishing  but at some point he thinks of the lantern
still a coincidence  timing and all
if i whistle  those boysll see you and come runnin  uyoureu the story today
now this jury is gonna be lookin at the evidence with one eye and at you with the oth
i think you testified uallu the lights were on  cabin mast net lights picking lights
sheriff how many batteries and what size did you find on udefendantsu boat
i believe so
you dont  uthinku so
operating this winch youd rarely operated before doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 poundsis it upossibleu  possible that he struck his head uafteru death possible
and her farmhouse
one d6 and one d8 in the well and a dead d8 on the deck
can you tell whether an object moved against the head or the other way around  or would both look the same
for certain no
are you absol
i guess youd have to guess not having been there with them having to guess whether your husbands report was word for word accurate
the question is more about the udefendantsu attitu
well the soldiers weve got now theyve been through all kinds of heavy shitand theyve always got the job done  now these new ones these hot shots of yourswhat kind of action have they seen  they uareu battletested arent they
forget it doll  after all you work here  i work here  and believe you me its nice to have you with the organization
because im working the night shift  and i got a bottle of gin stashed away  and as soon as theres a lull

im sorry sir  general schmuck is asleep and he isnt taking calls until eightthirty
may i be stupid enough to inquire why in hell the base commander of the 843d bomb wing did a thing like that 
damn it  damn it  ive been telling you all for years youve got too damned many psychoes in the service
well sir they may not allow the special service troops to enter the base
thats right  i want this flashed to all section immediately
yes major  this looks like its going to be it
now as soon as youve done that double up on all base security teams  our enemies are plenty smart and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs
i see youre playing your radio major isnt that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base
i didnt mean for anyone to play anyone elses radio either major
but then sir why have you issued the order wing attack planr
i suppose they are sir
how much soda sir
that about right
general ripper can i ask another question
i suppose we might catch them off their guard
well i know theyve been going on for years and they havent gotten any place
dont be offended major  our president holds the same views
thats right sir  but the planes were at their positive control points ready to turn around when general ripper issued the final gocode
but hell hear everything were saying  and if he just looks out of that window hell see everything were doing 
how long will it take to receive them all
he says theyve only shot down three planes
how do you know they were shot down buck
is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy air defense when its course and target are known

they cant touch us at this height
hey king  somebody at burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor
okay  check these points  complete radio silence  to ensure that the enemy cant plant false transmissions and fake orders the crm114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits  the three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the crm114 which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters you got it
lieutenant toejam are you ready for bim and bam

hi nicole
ill be back around nine
well i dont know why it should theres a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits  were hardly unique here billy  i mean i can understand how you feel
if that bastard does subpoena me if he forces me to go over this again then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing
nicoles coming over to look after the kids tonight  shell be there around six
does this mean i cant take a shower
what times he coming home
your kids never cry
youre leaving
i stopped by the station a while ago  i stared at the bus  i could almost hear the kids inside  there was a lawyer there  he told me hed gotten you signed up  is that true
or that the guardrail wasnt strong enough
because i have to
dolores  no one calls me mrs driscoll
no nothing like that  the ottos are what id call model citizens theyre regular at town meetings they give their opinions  in a respectful way  they always help out at various fundraising bazaars in town  though they arent church goers
those are all from the fair last year  abbott and me were judges at the pet show
from what
thats the way i thought of them sometimes
abbott and i used to do a lot of that in the spring
you hate it
you want a cup of tea or something
but dolores said she saw a dog and tried to
and winter
how was it
from you
nicole
yes
i dont like thinking about the accident  i dont even remember it happening  besides it just makes people feel sorry for me and
it would be strange if you didnt feel that way
they work for the people were trying to sue  their job is to try to minimize damages  our job nicole is to try to maximize them you have to think of it that way as people doing their jobs  no good guys or bad guys  just our side and their side
it was snowing
note my objection  she said as im talking
what about doreen
remember that time we were having the car washed and i started playing with the automatic window  how old was i daddy  five or six  i got absolutely soaked remember
thats not news zoe
now on that morning did there come a time nicole when you left your parents house
i will offer that report  well then now that your memory seems to be clearing can you tell us what else  you observed at that time
this is before the accident nicole do you understand what im asking
mrs  driscoll was driving too fast what made you think that nicole
seventytwo miles an hour  youre sure of this
of course
do you like the colour
youre going to need special care for a long time to come  its not going to be easy  not for you not for any of us  because we love you so much  and its going to cost money  more than we can imagine
partly  but theres a lot the insurance doesnt cover  thats one of the reasons we have a lawyer  to make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest
what are you up to nicole
nothing good on your tv
nicole tomorrow mr stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse  i thought id take you over
will the police do anything to her
that sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town  hes about to lose his house and car

excuse me steve  i said namely you shouldnt go around wild blaming people without justification
thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow
frank i think maybe you lied to me
you told me that your boy was washed up with susie hunsecker didnt you

blessings on thee the bothwell gotta run now  see you two kids later

does he have to be here in our hair
just exactly what are you so hot about  i mean i know its a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds but 
susie youre very much in my thoughts today
sidney is a liar
i started to say were drifting apart  a year ago in your wildest dreams would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me  today i had to call you in
no  no  dont touch me
now come jj thats a little too harsh  anyone seems fair game for you tonight
yeah  at bellevue  still hanging on  but they still dont know if she was pushed
why dont you answer the man sidalee  hes trying to take you off the hook
what some cheap gruesome gags
no lemme finish  i dont like this job  that boy is dumb only on matinee days  otherwise hes got a head  and susan like you said shes growing up  two heads what i mean we got a slippery dangerous problem here
correct me if im wrong  we because when im out on this very slippery limb for you you have to know whats involved
jj i want you to get them back their job steve and the quintet
he means that much to you
lets forget cats and dogs and other pseudoliterary remarks ill just lay it on the line  what about that big rumpus in my office today  you were there frank where according to st dallas jj was responsible for the elwell smear
why do something that would drive them right back into each others arms  not to mention that this time susie would know who shot the arrow
jj its one thing to wear your dog collarbut when it gets to be a nooseid rather have my freedom
i was trying to build her up not tear her down 
who put this item in about the comic  if theres a more hilarious funny man around than herbie temple at the palace youll have to pardon us for not catching the name  we were too busy screaming does this temple have a press agent
rita say hello to otis elwell
back
pay the rent  let the tailor wait
go home sally  its late
if thats for me tear it up
no i dont mind  im busy too
its given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself not just because im my brothers sister
susie whatever problems you have with jj  i didnt invent them whatre you blaming me for  if you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off
yeah  like me  i dont choke on my own gall  i fight back  let them choke not me
i know that bit  youre a girl you need a man to give you strength so what do you pick such weak sisters for  dont you know yet that you fight fire with fire not with tear drops

why do you cry
no fate  no fate but what we make  my father told her this i mean i made him memorize it up in the future as a message to her  never mind  okay the whole thing goes the future is not set  there is no fate but what we make for ourselves

vince dagosta  am i out
they heard the victims name and wove him into their story  nice touch
you think what weve got here is a monster as big as a house that smells like hamburger
i dont like animals  never have dog bit me when i was little  after that i gave up on pets  animals are irrational  give me a psychotic killer any day  if theres one thing that makes me queasy its being part of a food chain  my first case as a rookie two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo  it was late august  over ninety  the polar bear was inside his cave  kids didnt know he was in there  all they saw was the pool they got to swimming and splashing the noise woke up the bear  by the time i arrived both little boys were in pieces  the bear was dragging one kid around by the foot i can still hear the mother screaming 
how big is the subbasement
shouldnt a drug that powerful be destroyed
what happened
what does it say
what are we talking about here
now margo dont overreact  cuthbert has to cut costs somehow  my leaving makes perfect sense  this isnt exactly early retirement  ive overstayed the party a bit
like the claw
come on margo  were on the verge of something huge  lets consider the possibility just the three of us alone in this room  what if john was right  i mean what if  and he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates  when it got to the museum it hatched
all right assuming the program is accurate this is a description of the animal with that claw  species unidentified  genus unidentified  phylum unknown  male weight in excess of 240 kg  brain capacity 900 centimeters that means its highly intelligent quadrupedal
and its hungry  its been two days since its eaten  there are five hundred people arriving right now the animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell  all those people in one enclosed space
how many storage areas are there
something tried to get into this room
its from john  those two arrows were his insignia  its addressed to louis moriarty a patron who financed his expeditions
we think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate
whats that
i dont want to go this way
argo  hobbes
theres something out there  lets go get it now  thats why we came down here isnt it
if i spent half the time on my fractal evolution thesis that i spend on this fly rod id have my phd
i have the species identification on these teeth  we can extract dna and start running tests on the extrapolator program  call dr frock  he wanted a demonstration
what
4monoxytocin is a hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland
no  im all right  i wont let this affect me anymore  john wouldnt get help  his ego endangered the lives of others  his theory came first
wounded
hide quickly
you smell that
no  dont kill him  pendergast you were right  its john
just like john  he wont listen
its the busy season
why is he in the basement
what happened down there
the catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course trumans father kirk and his infiltration onto the show before we discuss that its worth reminding viewers that this isnt the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach truman
and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role  i really must congratulate you on writing kirk back in  a master stroke
i understand hes hardly had a life of his own since he left the show  how did you convince himwas it the opportunity to be close to truman again
how idoi you intend to explain his twenty two year absence
but recent events have been so dramatic it does raise the perennial question what keeps us watching this one man twentyfour hours a day  eating sleeping working sitting for hours in contemplation
he was curious from birth  premature by two weeks as if he couldnt wait to get started
nothing was real
but why didnt he just follow her to fiji
how can they have a child
why not
well what do you want to do
i figured whats the point  i knew id just be taking my problems with me  once the kids came along it made me look at seahaven with new eyes  i realized what the hell could be better than this  im telling you  what you really need is someone to carry on the burbank name
im onto something marlon  something big
theres no point in trying to explain it but a lot of strange things have been happening  elevators that dont go anywhere people talking about me on the radio you know what i mean
i think its got something to do with my dad
and the last thing id ever do is lie to you  think about it truman if everybodys in on it id have to be in on it too im not in on it because there is no iiti
i was hoping we could have a special evening
whatre you doing down here
what did you want
youre a nurse arent you
i invited marlon and rita for a barbeque sunday  i thought id make my potato salad  remind me
truman i took the hypocrite oath
truman what about that sign
stop this now  ill do it  i swear
how are you mother
you got it
well thank you for your help
hows it going truman
good  good
poopy day
i think that about does it spooky
are you going to let us in on what exactly youre trying to prove 
what is it you find incredible
this mans still alive
yes
feds are looking for him too  real nice business hes got huh
you looking for him for some other reason
was there anything in those offices that didnt go to dc
howd you find me
you a reporter
for what because im a dangerous man because i know too much about the truth
and are you familiar with fema what the federal emergency management agencys real power is fema allows the white house to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency to create a nonelected government think about that  what is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban texas
what was it
ill know soon enough
and they tell me im paranoid
how can i reach you
you found something
ive just climbed twelve floors im hot and thirsty and im wondering to be honest what im doing here
alright whatll it be coke pepsi a saline iv
theyre trying to divide us on this scully we cant let them
what kind of infection
you said you werent coming
this looks like new grass to you
grounds dry about an inch down somebody just laid this down very recently id say
what
this is weird mulder
any thoughts on why anybodyd be growing corn in the middle of the desert
whered they go
i already gave skinner my letter of resignation
why was i assigned to you to debunk your work to reign you in to shut you down
cold
i cant go any farther
on whose orders
sit down theyre still talking to agent scully
 if it looks bad its bad for the fbi 
shes in there right now saying the same thing about you
mr mulder
is she alive
im quite prepared to tell you everything though there isnt much you havent guessed
i think of it as an agreement a word your father liked to use
until dallas we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism that mass infection would make us a slave race
but he sacrificed his own daughter my sister samantha
let me remind you who is the new race and who is the old  what could be gained by withholding anything from them by pretending to ignorance our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable to start colonization early
did we go sailing
it could take years for me to get past the barriers hes created
id be there for him
sing a song of sixpence
nothing
the first what  six or seven times i went in   remember what happened
this isnt your responsibility remember that  dont let them use guilt as a tool  if you want to stop say so
catherine  im about to start  if you want me to wait or
is it cold in here
a pocketful of rye
i refilled the zyprexa and atavan
what if he wasnt like this  what if he was normal  conscious  how far would you go
sometimes once theyve been caught they feel a need for disclosure  they have so much they want to tell but theyve never had a sympathetic ear they need someone to understand why  stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully  it was part of the ritual some werent found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean  but these last three they were still in water  always in water  but  listen he wasnt just careless  it went beyond that
absolutely  i suppose everyone does
with stargher i saw things
whyd you bring him here
you think you can do this dont you
this is stargher were talking about
whoa  hold on  arent they the same guy
evil
what happened
a child can experience abuse worse than charlies  and grow up to be someone who would never ever hurt another living thing
remember julia hickson is priority number one  nothing else matters  find out where she is
you sure about this
well look at that
thank you
not a gift  a highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex thats all  a genetic fluke
into stargher  inside
is she alright
hows the patient
what about the cat
so
i need it
the dogs an albino  hed love an animal like that
how is she
here he is
you sure you want to go through with this
i dont know pete but for gods sake this is nuts  do you really understand what theyre going to do
why jeopardize what weve already done we caught the sonofabitch  carl stargher  thats going to be like bundy gacy dahmer  a case that makes careers  but if we push our luck  if this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it
hier sind fruher fursten ans unt eingeganger hier hat sogar ein metternich verkehrt

there are infinite worlds out there where anything that can happen does happen
too far
and you if you had come out of egypt you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the golden calf
that was an ark man that was a torah they fucked around with it and the torah melted their faces
where did you read this robert faurisson

carla its me dannydanny balint we met at thatmeeting at your house
i thought there were people here
whos eichmann
shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod
why are you taking that
danny the night we met you said the name ilio manzetti we were impressed we were excited but here it is september and mr manzetti is still walking around breathing the air
is it okay if i record this
im trying to figure out where the radical right is going to nexti thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting
you ever fuck a jewish girl
those arent jews
were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else
thats what im trying to find out danny who am i fucking with here
why would nadelman lie
but if the jews are strengthened by hate wouldnt this destruction you speak of  by love or by any other means  in fact make them more powerful than they are already
did you kill ilio manzetti
two days ago you addressed a nazi rally last week you went to a torah study group
i dont think you know what you are
its too late if i didnt somebody else would  yom kippur starts at sundown will you go to synagogue
you know the joke a jews shipwrecked on a desert island when they rescue him they see hes built two synagogues they say for vhat do you need two synagogues he says vun to pray in and vun id never set foot in so long as i live so help me god  you pray in the one youd never set foot inand vice versa
it was a nine millimeter
so are you but theyll believe you  lina moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea that you proposed it in a meeting at her house  ah jesus danny what were you thinking are you glad manzettis dead do you really want to kill jews you want to kill me
dont tell me what i 
no
are you with the fbi mr balint or any other law enforcement agency

hammer you alright
i shlepped all the way to the north pole for this i come to fight you and you dont even put out anything to nosh on what kind of arch nemesis are you
when you marry champagne cloclo you cant trade it in for beer youre stuck with it
why do you ask so many questions what difference does it make how carlos and i feel feeling does not buy clothes and houses
sure i like my leopards
what did they say before the bad card came up
well  did he give you a lot of money
cut
see you tomorrow 
it may sound like music to her  i can do better with my teeth in a cold shower  click  click  click
yes so ive noticed jerrys noticed  hell come up with something
oh thats so interesting
there is no danger at all its a wild animal do you think a wild animal prefers walls streets and people when it can get into open country
why
yes but what sort of a man
hed act normally when he was with other people it would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over
then you found the leopard 
ive disturbedyou im sorry 
wait 
what are you getting at
yes the lipstick
get it out of here
on his back i suppose
makes no difference  get him out
on his back i suppose
you look swell in that threealarm number 
suppose i slip them a few bucks  for the funeral expenses
jerry these flowers arent really for me 
as a matter of fact im out of cash myself
i  i bought some silver jewelry and stuff from eloise 
i hated you that day  you and your flip talk  with that little girl lying dead
hot  these roads all round here closed to the public whys that military bases  huh i guess theres space enough for war games must be good for business
all those soldiers out there getting bored thirsty come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps
you wouldnt recall if the brothersinlaw left together would you
now you know why youre here mr lombard  it might be difficult for someone like you to discern but we are people of a certain standing
what about you mrs de moraes
ohoh touch mr lombard but tell me what would you know about sisterly love eh  no dont you might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear headed at least until youve done what we are paying you for
your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place mrs de moraes and having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise  you dont mess around with child procurers right now my guess is hes either on the run held captive or dead  i understand your misgivings mrs de moraes but ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man leon bought him from if anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man which leads me to why im here at such a late hour i need 20000 in cash by 11 this morning
huh who do you think we are mr lombard
huh really hotels
mr lombard
or is it the other way round the children are needed because you cant satisfy him
huh dont you recall convincing me he had  you should learn to live with your mistakes mr lombard there is some merit in it
leons not found your parents worry talk of hiring help to find him even mention their manhunter friends perhaps and adonis panics takes control brings me in reckoning a small time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward not before leons found anyhow he must have kicked himself when he learned id exceeded his expectations
i doubt friedman ever even met leon deborah friedman dealt with select customers as for my envelope had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called lamont when we met in los angeles
youre wrong about my being there though carlos borrowed my car that day his had broken down  leon saw it like you assumed i was there thought hed wait to ask for a lift but carlos turned up with the tape you found  leon got his lift and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out he watched it confronted carlos threatened to tell the police about the hotel i dont know how he knew about the hotel perhaps carlos talked too much my husband did not tell me you more or less guessed the rest  i didnt know any of this before you left for los angeles
why did you send me after friedman to atone for your sins
one just doesnt tell me what does one speak about huh
is there anything to understand
are there truly no extenuating circumstances
what happened adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice
dont you believe in simplicity
to get me killed
you know something ive just seen so much ugliness i dont think id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time  id hoped to have a private word with adonis but if thats the way you want it
the staff dont know yet  i called my parents told them everything  i just couldnt take any more
penrhyndeudraeth north wales
is this some kind of sick stunt let me guess  you want money right
i cant believe this  whats coming now eh if i dont pay all hells gonna break loose is that it
have you never heard of collect calls mr
right well ill get your money first thing in the morning okay  okay goodnight then
route 395 past edwards air force base and about half a mile before a place called the red mountain motel theres a dirt track with a closed to the public sign it leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere if you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry okay but not before you hear
im finished here and im tired emily you shouldnt be here now dont make it worse
im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained but they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases
on the bed
i dont know hes gone  hes gone i dont fucking know where i swear hes gone on holiday
there were six on offer you scumbag where are the other five
how many of you scumbags are here
whats the ambassador
where is it
fine how was the match did you loose
have you heard of a french film called la collectionoose
ive got work tonight jane
id appreciate it if you could do this for me if you cant dont worry about it ill call in about an hour anyway sorry but im in a hurry 
may i
lombard this is not a jewish name is it
what if it is
you may not and besides it is irrelevant
check with your sons bank banks dont usually give out information about their customers
did you look for his passport driving licence
so he could have decided to go on a trip
any friends
the 1000 is on account
look at it this way he might achieve everything your son never did
problems
friedman lives with you at the ambassador
is this friedman martin  come on scumbag youve reached your sell by date tell me if this is friedman where he is in los angeles and what name hes using
at what time will you be available
this is private property the public footpath is back to the left of the bridge
you thought wrong i havent seen leon for months
he just said he had good reasons
yeah but he didnt beat the demons  a quarter of all the shoes sold in europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire all started from a small shop in the east end of london and war reparation money for holocaust victims
i cant think of a good reason for it  for now anyway my number if anything happens whats your sisters number
no sick people in the country huh just tell me one thing rhian leons story about the boy you just took his word for it
the money leon left for the boy was it cash
you sure what about before he turned up with the boy
he showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street
and you aint neither one of those damned mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting rippedoff by their friendly cross border guides are you mister
welcome to the club
what about which girlfriend
yeah why youre going to look for her shit you really think his pictures are that good
alors
okay shitbag im only going to ask you this once where is friedman
gluck
so why didnt he
i think youd rather not know what i think
not even scum like friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call
what sums
moreau cest moi alors
are they still operative
oh dear why is life so complicated sometimes i really wish i could be someone else
jean its its not so easy
he didnt tell you to cut all your hair off
whats going on
not so easily  why arent you fighting  go on were almost there
alright i promise to rest if you promise to go back to the battle
jeanne calm down do you hear me are you alright
ill go
i dont know it  i feel it
so even you dont believe in me anymore
its a trap  theyre buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from england
to be killed in battle
we must sound the retreat
do as i say
 and maybe the king will give you some money and a little land and a title even   wouldnt that be a fine thing you a lady of title
but that was her order
go onto the next question
and didnt you order the citizens of paris to surrender the city in the name of the king of heaven
i cant read
do you have a sword
yes maybe i dont remember
it is the sacred place that matters charles  not the size  am i correct bishop
wwwhat are you doing
be patient my lord youve seen how it is  this girl has a way with people but everyday were making progress
my king will pay any ransom you ask
god defeated the english not me
are you alright  did they hurt you
dont worry about me  just stay in here and dont move
but the king  my king  didnt he pay my ransom
take the holy gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked
you must take the oath  not even a king would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith
when exactly  a day a week  when
what did it tell you
tell us jeanne do you often hear this voice
jeanne i beg of you sign  in gods name dont you understand im trying to save you  if you dont sign the english will burn you to death  is that what you want
sign this and i will confess you myself if you want
please may i have it back
good day sir  i trust my honorable duke of burgundy is feeling well
thanks be to god
mmmm  yes  i know for example the sickness that plagues your heart  i know how painful it is for you to have loved a father without ever knowing if he really was yours
its true  theres only one king people need to be reminded of that nevertheless jeanne has done so much for us
dont worry charles  if god is still with her she will be victorious  were not her judges were just spectators  let her go to compiegne as you let her go to orleans and let god decide her fate
theres no need to be afraid sire
hes probably right  lets call a delay
i i dont know itll sound like we betrayed her
does he have hair
but if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel or a man how would you recognize him  by what he said
5000 gold crowns
it is all his majesty can afford he has even donated his very own personal savings  his majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families
may i without offending you inquire how generous
well  id love to see that but after taking counsel with my captains i felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city then wait till alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything
be patient be patient is that the only advice you can ever come up with  ive shown more patience than a dozen saints
jeanne what are you doing with that youve got it back to front
and its not the first one  they say she saved a little boy who was dying of
i do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked
there must be something we can do for her for chrissakes
do you know how to count
did your voice tell you to jump
so when you jumped you wanted to kill yourself
but you cant just kill a man for his teeth
besides what about these
yeah
jeanne let me introduce the kings half brother the dogged lord dunois
what happened  who gave the order to attack
i swear ill never swear again in my life if you save her life  but im warning you if you let her die then youre the biggest
we won
you dont believe me anymore
how many did he give you
jeanne what are you doing
who who are you
i dont know what do you want from me
what are you doing out here
yes thats what i pray for
no no  you cant stay or they wont come
no  that was a sword in a field
let all who love me follow me where does god get mentioned  come on jeanne be honest  you fought for yourself in your name
i dont agree  why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time
are you going to leave me too
you think you are ready now
i saw a poor monk without shoes so i gave him some
he already did but i want god to forgive me too
him
who is this he
i heard about your sister and i understand your pain
im sorry mr wladek he wants you to stop
