im on duty
you wanna talk to her alone
youre her savior  is she the kid youre gonna save from the burning building
well its not up to you to decide whether shes innocent or not  dont you understand thats why youre a professional
how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer  here heres a number of an immigration lawyer  thats how you help her but you cant get involved in her like that  youre gonna jeopardize your career your life and youre gonna jeopardize my case  and lemme give you another piece of advice  maybe you dont watch tv but ill let you in on a little secret  the whole fuckin world watches television  and when you get out there they know your face  and the little fame the little fuckin itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job  and i get more done because of it
you know i dont know  i like you you remind me of a puppy i used to have he pissed on the rug all the time but i still kept him

i ordered a czech girl  daphne you know her
where is escort service

paulie youve got kids right

arent you tired
it hurts  aw jesus
not good
you seem very savvy for a man whos been found mentally incompetent to stand trial
im afraid ive only got a few minutes but id love to
were trying to get there i hope we can
interesting that you mention it because ive got the same problem
yes
i dont think we should make any fuss about it yet im sure theyll straighten it out
that seems very unlikely
well now that weve got one thats actually failed we should be able to figure out whats happened and fix it
i guess you dont know your own strength old boy
and dont you worry about it
it doesnt have to be hal its more dangerous to be out of touch with earth let me have manual control please
still you really dont believe it do you
well the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going what will we do when we get there when are we coming back and why are we going
im fine daddy when are you coming home
shes in the bathroom
yes daddy
oh shes growing up very fast as a matter of fact shes six tomorrow
no thank you and im afraid now i really must be going
thank you its been a great pleasure to meet all of you dr smyslov
are you quite sure
well its just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius
yes well for one thing whenever you phone the base all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order
you mean you havent been able to get anyone at the base for ten days
yes well i hope the crew got back safely
im afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement
theres nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest
well the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit  about twentyfour hours and then were going to back empty
no of course captain i can understand your concern
thank you very much hal
it looks like we have another bad ao unit my fpc shows another impending failure

im afraid not
come come mozart im interested truly
i dont think you should become known in vienna as a debtor mozart however i know a very distinguished gentleman i could recommend to you and he has a daughter will that do
thank you oh thank you
i think its marvelous truly
i think you overestimate our dear viennese my friend do you know you didnt even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap

well not especially it can be in turkish if you really want i dont care
just let me tell you how it begins
certainly herr director
yes but this is not a ballet this is a dance at figaros wedding
but surely the emperor didnt mean to prohibit dancing when its part of the story
because his majesty wishes it
a little modesty would suit you better
may i just do that majesty show you how it begins just that
you tried to take your life you do remember that dont you
i didnt that was mozart wolfgang amadeus mozart you know who that is
ah  youve heard that
did you try
my son no one can speak for god
no father from now on no one will be able to speak of mozart without thinking of me whenever they say mozart with love theyll have to say salieri with loathing and thats my immortality  at last our names will  be tied together for eternity  his in fame and mine in infamy at least its better than the total oblivion hed planned for me your merciful god
italian

anything thats not even credible if he wants to go up there to check it out i think you should encourage him  its his life but everybodys treating him like this  valuable object youre hurting your own case
if hes really a bully he wont cop to it anyway
didnt you visit the campus
no way you have this  destiny
thats what i need to ask you  you know you cant keep anything from me
what would it mean anyway if he didnt write it
youre right its  a working relationship dont know what i was expecting

gary dont worry we 
knows im altering the coordinates lets jump to 12
well come up with the next big thing
something like that yeah
whys that
she saved my life
why would you do a thing like 
the day care
but why would they 
timewarner has a 40 per cent stake in garys settop device that also takes out cnn  ge joins outpost in new venture which means nbc is out disney joins outpost abc is out outpost and newscorp in new deal fox is out any of these places could have a mole or all of em  its like a a continuous loop we can go to some alternative press place that 1000 people read get them and us killed but anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something garys got a finger in
you mean  break in
cause their apartments might be bugged
milo shrot suspects somebody broke into 21 i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts
its three years old it 
uh not exactly
jesus teddy

shes a programmer
ive got a girlfriend remember
21 way behind schedule its top secret but everybody knows its a digital broadcast space they see the dishes on top the fiber optics going in

mr powers please i know that you must be a little confused but we have a very serious situation at hand i would appreciate it if youd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest

people have to tell me these things ive been frozen for thirty years throw me a bone here  ok no problem heres my second plan back in the sixties i had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a laser  using this laser we punch a hole in the protective layer around the earth which we scientists call the ozone layer slowly but surely ultraviolet rays would pour in increasing the risk of skin cancer that is unless the world pays us a hefty ransom

yeah in fact i just dropped off a letter to the times explaining how yesterdays arson announcement was a fabrication by your office they loved it and you know what you were right my family background in firefighting gave it weight
theres no replacement cause of your boss cuts if thats what you mean if someone else goes out on an injury were really screwed

youd take no offense if we called you dela for short
manray needs a job
my world famous famous world arroz con pollo will be ready very soon
eureka

yes  yes  yes  i want a show that will make headlines that will have millions and millions of households tuned in glued to their televisions every week  i want advertisers dying to buy on this show  im gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you
this could be bigger than amos and andy
so what  we would just give the naacp a donation that would be the end of that  no such thing as bad publicity  so what  earlier you said singing and dancing
who are the other characters
i just want you to meet him  keep an open mind
probably nuthin but thats why its such a sexy way to go sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook a different unique perspective  a black director yknow what hes gonna do given the subject matter  with this kid the possibilities are endless
no  just meet the guy  thats all im asking  look ill even let you choose your own musical director  you can have that
calm down please
i seriously doubt that will ever happen  didnt i tell you i know your people better than you do but if by some miracle youre correct im gonna invite them inside my house and well have a sit down discuss it like civil human beings
the big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier  from the gitgo from jump street
because i had too much pride  too much integrity  i wouldnt lick nobodys butt  some material i refused to do
nuthin i cant handle
i was a hostess at this club your daddy was performing and i had never laughed so hard in my life he asked me to come with him  i quit my job and weve been together ever since
it hit me like a ton of bricks
the idea was out there in the universe  now what
and lose out on my money  the only way i get paid is if i get fired and thats what i intend to do
i feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer
it was the principle  dunwitty had to be enlightened  i was making a point  i take pride in my work plus i already told you i wasnt gonna walk away from my money
im gonna slit my wrists  cut my throat  for the love of joseph
im sorry i cant help it  its too funny
i thought it was appropiate
youre the one that put us together were friends
hes just playing big brother
i cant lie to him  if he asks me something i tell him what i think
david i appreciate your comments anybody got an ideas  everybody just talk out loud
pressure  dela you dont know what the hell real pressure is sheeett  this is lightstuff now when you scramblin out on the street in da january winter and the hawk is talkin to you with no money and no prospects of money anytime soon now that there is some pressure
now im privileged  why  because i didnt grow up on food stamps and welfare  because i didnt call home a cardboard box  no i never ever went to bed hungry and im proud of it too  whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you
same thing giuliani said
hope the same thing doesnt happen to me  thats some big shoes to fill
yo dela they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece
cmon mommy dont start with that im an ungrateful son stuff
son peerless is your name  now you might be one of these hollywood types change your name and all that but peerless dothan is on your birth certificate
i will  and good luck with your show  i hope its a huge success youve worked very hard  you deserve it

well before there was black or african american there were negroes  im a negro
thank you very much  i always try my best
a little  i just graduated from nyu film school  cinema studies

but swords are today impossible captain best is  is lame  he knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night as he was riding home and can scarce move it now
repeat the words again and i run you through the body
i deny your graces accusations and beg you to say how you have been cheated
i have orders to gag your honor if you cry out and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not
yes sir  here is my letter
no one sir  before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins
have no fear  it will come out well for me
i have faced that problem before
to risk ones life against such people is an imposition
very well  now that i know it i will no longer love her
how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you
it is nonetheless a misfortune and you will know it when you love
yes  but i am afraid of being deceived
always my dear one never any further  love is a child to be pacified with trifles  a full diet can only kill it
o my dearest love  enough  i beg you  stop believing in your experience  you have never known love  my very soul is leaving me catch it on your lips and give me yours
i had not been in the room five minutes before i was engaged for every single set
i dont care a fig for captain best he dances prettily to be sure and is a pleasant rattle of a man  he looks well in his regimentals too and if he chose to ask me to dance how could i refuse him
well then ill tell you what id do  id jump daisy into the river and swim you both across where no enemy could follow us
it is entirely up to you  i want the best
you must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in dublin where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound i hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house where captain oreilly will welcome with delight my gallant young preserver
provided that they can be assured of her ladyships freewill  are you serious
i am sorry for you mr james  im grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting  had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic  what are the odds gentlemen that i dont live to see mr james hang yet

when my folks split they gave me and tommy a choice who we wanted to live with i couldnt stand my dad but i knew if i moved to my moms id never see you again

its high time you realized honey babe that a woman doesnt have to give the best years of her life to radcliffe or smith in order to speak the english language
well er

american cheese the king of road food

when i was younger i hitchhiked one hundred and twentyseven hours without stopping without food or sleep crossed the continent twice in six days cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways
does that mean you might have an assignment for me
shit o dear thats enough to make me asthmatic the nerve of those twits what do they know about female odor dont interrupt heres my concept my ranch out west its a beauty ranch oh its got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes but its a beauty ranch a place where unhappy women  divorcees and widows mainly  can go to lose weight remove wrinkles change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment my ranch is named the rubber rose after the rubber rose douche bag my own invention and bless its little red bladder the most popular douche bag in the world so get this its on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes the last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence well these cranes stop off at my little pond  siwash lake its called  twice a year autumn and spring and spend a few days each time resting up eating doing whatever whooping cranes do ive never seen them understand but i hear theyre magnificent very big specimens  i mean huge mothers  and white as snow to coin a phrase except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers and bright red heads now whooping cranes in case you didnt know it are noted for their mating dance its just the wildest show in nature its probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons picture these rare beautiful gigantic birds in full dance  leaping six feet off the mud arching their backs flapping their wings strutting low to the ground dears its overwhelming and picture the birds doing their sex dance on tv right there on the home screen creations most elaborate sex ritual  yet clean and pure enough to suit the pope with lovely sissy hankshaw in the foreground in a white gown red hood attached and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black in a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane she dancewalks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of yoni yum and a can of dew offcamera a string quartet is playing debussy a sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love are you starting to get it doesnt it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud my very goodness gracious grandiose lyrical erotic and girl scout oriented you cant top it ive hired a crew of experts from walt disney studios the best wildlife cinematographers around youre my eternal favorite princess grace herself couldnt be better not even if she had your personality which she doesnt anyway dear im out of photography now and into water colors ah how circuitous conversation is were back at the beginning the exact man ive wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist

i am your best friend i am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker
justin
dont start with me cooper
on my way
what
no thank you
skipper do we get hazard pay for this
i know what i saw and it wasnt a fucking optical effect
i dont know the process dr weir was the expert
no
ive been listening to the transmission and i think houston made a mistake in the translation
oh god
his peritoneum has ruptured
i apologize for the short notice bill but weve had something come up that requires your immediate attention lyle
a written briefing cant possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this i have to go with them
thank you
you dont just dismiss bill weir the man held oppenheimers chair at princeton if the event horizon had worked he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since einstein
its been two years since she died hes over it
the dark inside me
the dark inside i dont understand
justin i wont let you die
dr weir admiral hollis would like to see you as soon as possible
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers  good for four months
so where are they starck any luck with the bioscan
what you got peters
the science workstation has power ill see if i can find the crew from here
hows the client
skipper
ill get back to the log but on the bridge i wont go back back in there
doctor weir my crew is not going on your mission because we want to we were pulled off a well deserved leave to be sent out to the middle of nowhere and no ones even told us why
exactly the ships internal clock is off by seven years
i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity that should prevent another power drain
thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly causing reverberations 
we will take the lewis and clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the event horizon until i am satisfied that she has been destroyed  fuck this ship
just get your gear back onto the lewis and clark doctor or youll find yourself looking for a ride home
i dont need them anymore where were going we wont need eyes to see
you know
better if i just show you
where is it
we dont have time to fart
no ones dying on my watch smith what about the reserve tanks
im here smith hows the clark
captain we got a problem
justin
i just finished drying
come around to threethreefour
were all here
whats causing the readings
dr weir you were right there you must have heard something seen something
were hanging on by our fingernails and youre giving me bullshit stories
starck do you know how crazy that sounds its impossible
youre at the bridge ms peters you still havent seen any crew
theres no one here
isnt it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge
shes not ugly
1000 meters
i dont think this is a good idea we dont even know what happened on that ship
wrong the shortest distance between two points
do they have pressure
if they were in stasis id get a location but these readings theyre all over the ship it doesnt make any sense
ships log
i cant believe we built this
im alright please
trust me this aint one of those times
i wouldnt know anything about that

she was about to get married again she locked me out of the bedroom last night
when

i dunno you know  i used to really love that alice do you know that
the posies are for her

scat
leave a tip
beat the shit out of someone who hates you
nothing
its your house dad
did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire
the pelt is black  its a kind of man
situation
youd better get dr woodly
we thought a doctor might help
paul said you were awfully sick
nothing would please me more
have some
you and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles  you know who filled that bag for you  not alicesitbythefires like yourself  men with guts filled it by godmen with guts enough to pay the price for miraclessuffering ingratitude loneliness death
he thought he could take my place it is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why i dont think hes man enough to do that
i did
justbangwe have a honeymoon
ram it up your ass
bring me a side order of mrs wheeler
what a honeymoon
this is not a coy deception  i do not want to be scrogged  i want love  i want tenderness
well i can  some injuries spiritual or physical can be excruciating to me  im not a silly carhop any more  maybe youre right about fish when i was a carhop i didnt feel much more than a fish would  but ive been sensitized  i have ideas nowand solid information  i know a lot more nowand a lot of it has to do with you
i learned a lot of things in college  actuallyit was norbert who told me that
yes
what are you going to do
it isnt a matter of liking  its a matter of getting used to death as a perfectly natural thing would you mind leaving  no woman ever walks out on harold ryan and then comes backfor anything
more nerve than the doctor i must admit  he hasnt been home for two days  has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color televisionand the violin
im dying to hear of his reaction the thrill of smashing something isnt in the smashing but in the owners reactions
you feel ive done a dreadful thingleaving him
just one favor
i see
how unhappy hes going to bealone in his room
blue soup
if he thinks hes man enough
if thats the casewhats to prevent my killing myself
if youve lived a good life fought well
dont
then youd better fix your bayonet because there arent any bullets in the gun
youve killed women
of course he can goif hell just go down on his hands and knees for a momentand promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree
oh oh ohi thought it was your apartment  you seemed at home here
what a brilliant diagnosis
i know malaria  malaria isnt caused by the bites of bats
colonel harper and i once shared a treetop with a family of bats there was a flash flood  there were piranha fish in the water thats how colonel harper lost his little toe
chills fevers sweats  you can describe it and name it after yourself the woodly galloping crud
i was going to ask
are youve seen it work cures
i can just hear the editorial wee weeweeing when looseleaf and i start flying in pacqualinincheewa root  i can hear the alicesitby thefires now we discovered it in the amazon rain forest  now we cure you with it  now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks
you were wrong you quack
lest we forget how cruel you are
its healer to killer  is that the same thing
and the hell with it  it was so tragically irrelevant so preposterously misinformed
if you want to be found that way
colonel harper retired now dropped an atom bomb on nagasaki during the second world war killing seventyfour thousand people in a flash
yeahcripes  i never did get any sense out of alice  she found me holding up the old lady dead as a mackerel  it was a bitch  you knowmaybe mrs wheeler was going to die then and there anyway even if id been the paper boy  maybe not  i dunno boy  thats civilian life for you  who knows what kills anybody
i dunno
what will you do colonel
thought you were another wife maybe
thats what he wanteda tenyear old wife  hed come home from a war or a safari and hed wind up talking to the little kids
yes
that is sad
everybody talks about how rotten kids act  grownups can be pretty rotten too
ill kill myself
wouldnt you rather have your mother marry me than him
hes coming back mom  hes the bravest most wonderful man who ever lived
youre married  youve already got a husband
i was afraid to ask
i didnt know that
to only exercise dr woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign  peace  peace  peace everybody
it is you isnt it harold
oh
a monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat
keeps fairies away
doing what
something happens to my confidence
if youll pardon the expression thats when youll see the fur and feathers fly  good night
far as i know
its dark in there penelope and thats where he is
you figure
how nice
he said one other thing  it wasnt very nice
we got a birthday cake kid  did you see the cake

whats so wonderful if i lost the sale  you poor kid
wellit was nice while it lasted thanks for the memories
hes the most wonderful guy i ever met penelope  hes the most complicated guy i ever met  i cant believe it but hes going to take me to africa with him
would you like to say something about killing colonel
as long as he keeps out of the park
meaning
hes not your son
its a jungle out there
hed go to a movie  i think thats what hed do  if i were sure he was in a movie i could stop worrying  we could have him paged
we met here earlier this evening
tell her to have a nice trip
im glad you brought your vacuum cleaner
penelope  were late
maybe god has let everybody who ever lived be rebornso he or she can see how it ends  even pithecanthropus erectus and australopithecus and sinanthropus pekensis and the neanderthalers are back on earthto see how it ends theyre all on times squaremaking change for peepshows  or recruiting marines
what a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage

they mocked me they were representations of people i dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me and that in time all i would have left would be vague feelings  but sharp photographs so i tossed them out my memory fades i know but i prefer pictures made by me with feeling and not by kodak with silver nitrate

what about you you got a crew already
how grave
mike
im told unusual promises were made to wigand
and im told there are questions as to our star witness veracity
they own the information hes disclosing the truer it is the greater the damage to them if he lied he didnt disclose their information and the damages are smaller
okay about this whistleblower did mike and don go along with the corporate decision
try the car
whos calling
did you say berman
its stuart hes in mexico city
theyre pretending its process bullshit its foregone
no you do not
yeah
whats this
who are these people

put the corporation at risk give me a fucking break
do me a favor will you spare me for gods sake get in the real world what do you think im going to resign in protest to force it on the air the answer is no i dont plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of national public radio  that decision ive already made
no i usually sit around in my hotel room dressed like this at 530 in the morning sleepy look on my face
im going to tell you why because when i tell someone im going to do something i deliver
you and i have been doing this together for fourteen years
no we dont do that  youve seen 60 minutes and mike wallace so you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity you also know we are the highestrated mostrespected tvmagazine news show in america

and i dont like paranoid accusations im a journalist think use your head how do i operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it
no i did not big tobacco is a big story and you got something important to say i can tell  but yes i did i came all the way down here to tell you story no story fuck your story i dont burn people
makes you feel good putting what you know to use
you charge by the hour
theyre gonna dig up stuff from your past theyre gonna throw it at you i got to know what theyre gonna throw you understand
i dont think you really understand 
they do this with impunity
i know im going to go there tonight
run that sandefur piece on nicotines not addictive run that oncamera then cut right to wigand with i believe they perjured then go wide to the ceos all taking the oath back on jeff and play the pause after the word felt on the bside
i do not think that you know for me what it is to walk in my shoes  for my kids to have seen it for them to know why ive put them through what i did the public airing of that the testament to why i did what i did youre telling me is not going to see the light of day
what
i fought for you and i still fight for you
what
what do you mean followed you did you call the police
well what do you really think though
you called me
where you staying now
dr wigand you do understand what could happen dont you
part of the reason im here is i felt that their representation clearly misstated at least within brown  williamsons representation clearly misstated what is common language within the company we are in the nicotine delivery business
youre gonna get your fix
in other words you were charging sandefur and brown  williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously
it acts as a drug on the body
when should we do this
miles i know youre busy and that you charge by the hour so ill come to the point howard and i are planning to marry
here got pictures

oh gee misteryou wouldntyou aint thinkin about
okay just remember that now beat it
my instinct is that ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating and well end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks  if we call him now he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot weve ever had
when youre in a war boss you use every weapon you got
you tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this clay bertrand and asked to fly to dallas and be lee oswalds layer
now thats pretty important dean you also told the fbi when you met him he was six foot two  then you tell the commission he was five foot eight  how the hell did the man shrink like that dean
oh i first heard these street cats jiving about him back in 56 57 when i lived down in the quarter
swishes  they swish yknow  young fags you know  theyd come into my bureau needing help no bread and id say hey man i aint rockefeller who gonna back you up  these cornmuffins go to the phone and dial
mario jose  they wear names like you and i wear clothes  today the name is candy tomorrow its butsie i wish i could help you jim
you know what i mean  i saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer  and a lotta strange people
maybe i have a little more respect for this countrys institutions than you do susie  you tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the mob the cia fbi and army intelligence and who knows what else when you know you cant even keep a secret in this room between 12 people  we got leaks everywhere were going to trial here  what the hell do we really got  oswald ruby banister ferrie are dead  shaw  maybe hes an agent i dont know but as a covert operator in my book hes wide open for blackmail cause of his homosexuality
hey where yat frank  youre wasting your time here  big jim gave strict orders  no fbi allowed
pretty fast wasnt it  the way they let him go
pretty flowery for dave ferrie
rumor is shaw a local boy was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement  no one really knows what they were doing there but everyone sure saw em they stood out like cottonballs  i got whites and blacks saw em but last time i checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote we still got the negro junkie vernon bundy saw em talkin at the seawall near lake pontchartrain  but its tough boss  no one wants to talk about shaw  hes
yeah  clay  i met him sometime in june of 62 at the masquerade bar dave ferrie took me there for the express reason to meet him
no youre awake bill and im dead serious  and were going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago  how did you find out dave ferrie drove to texas that day
oh jesus stoner why doesnt he call me
well they offered you the carrot and you turned it down you know whats coming next dont you boss
where you going boss
theres a word  orders
boss are you calling the president a murderer
yeah
if its a suicide i seen weirder jim 
no i did not
calm down dave what
what did they
that cocksuckin faggot  hes got me by the balls
theyre agency too  dont you get it  cia and mafia together  trying to whack out the beard  mutual interests  they been doing it for years  theres more to this than you dream  fbi fucking hates the cia  navy intelligence got something to do with it too  check out alan pope in miami  jack youngblood bill harvey  colonel roselli  the shooter i hear was a dallas cop  the bagman at rubys club  i heard he shot his own partner  got that check out the rich fucks in dallas hl hunt  hes dirty  thats all i know  but the agency always runs the show  check out something called mongoose  operation mongoose government pentagon stuff theyre in charge but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows fun n games man  check out southeast asia  thats the next big number  the heroin trail  oh what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive
but you are aware he served in your civil air patrol unit when he was a teenager
why galveston
and then sunday
you make it sound like some remote fuckin experience in ancient history man you never leave the agency once they got you youre in for life
well i heard dr humes stating that  he said
but you were a qualified pathologist was this army general a qualified pathologist
well it looks like it jasper
so off the record he starts talking about my family and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like i didnt know it or something  he got angrier and angrier and then
thats impossible  you heard echoes echoes  we have three bullets and three shots which came from the book depository and thats all were willing to say
negative on his tax records classified  first time i know a da cant get a tax record  i put together a list of all the cia files on oswald that were part of the warren report and asked for them  there are about 1200 documents  oswald in the ussr in mexico city oswald and the u2 a cia 201 personnel file a memo from the director on oswald travel and activities  cant get one of them  all classified as secret on the grounds of national security  its real strange
makes sense  hes a spokesman
presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at 125 an hour
bugging the district attorneys office of new orleans  its outrageous
mmmmm sure smells good but egghead do you realize oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination with no lawyer present and nobody recorded a word of it  i cant believe it  a police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that oswald said would be inadmissible in court
honey in all my years in the service i never knew a single man who was given a russian test  oswald was a radar operator  hed have about as much use for russian as a cat has for pajamas
itll be off the record honey ill bring him in on a sunday  a quiet little chat between gentlemen
you know i dont like these tribal rituals freckle face  im interviewing clay shaw this morning
but why in the lords name would you do it in the middle of easter sunday when you knew we were
i dont know what to tell them  how bout the truth  im doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice wont be an arcane vanished idea they read about in history books like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of atlantis
i dont want to see goddammit  im tired  ive had enough  they say you dont have anything anyway everybody in towns talking  youre ruining this man shaws life  youre attacking him because hes homosexual going ahead with this stupid trial did you ever once stop and consider what hes going through
i never doubted for a second that i was  will you come to the trial elizabeth
no word yet  but they think its in the head
lets get outta here lou  i saw too much stuff like this in the war
lou you were in the marines  who would be running that training
take a look across the street
upstairs  in 1963 that was the office of naval intelligence  and just by coincidence banister before he was fbi was oni  what do they say
we need to find more witnesses lou
i know you do lou  im doing three more lectures this month  youre all doing an incredible job sue al numa  but this is one where if you dont nail the other guy youre dead  how did jack ruby dies so quick  of what  cancer right  a history of nazi germany lou  they were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30s  we learned a lot more than you think from the nazis  read this our biological warfare lab is in fort detrick maryland  close to where the national cancer institute is located  think about it  think the unthinkable  question everything
id say the opposite  hypertension
how many men
who
allen dulles
you sure got it  youre one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch da and youre making one hell of a mistake
russell honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire  i just cant believe the chief justice of the united states would put his name on something that wasnt true
ive been called everything under the sun jerry  call me whatever you like
yes
ive already been warned by the agency mr whoever  if this is another type of threat i dont
no chance in hell mr garrison id be arrested and gagged declared insane and hospitalized maybe worse  you too  i can only give you background you got to find the foreground the little things keep digging  yknow youre the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of john kennedy  thats important  its historic
but you dont have a choice anymore youve become a significant threat to the national security structure they wouldve killed you already but you got a lot of light on you instead theyre gonna destroy your credibility they already have in many circles in this town  youre some kinda egocrazed southern caricature to many folks  be honest  the best chance you got is come up with a case something anything make arrests stir the shitstorm you gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack  remember fundamentally people are suckers for the truth and the truth is on your side bubba i hope you get a break
just think just think  what happened to our country  to the world  because of that murder vietnam racial conflict breakdown of law drugs thought control guilt assassinations secret government fear of the frontier
more than ten years
if you buy what you read in the paper
banister was running his camp north of lake pontchartrain  ferrie handled a lot of the training  there was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in cuba  a few americans got trained too  nazi types mercenaries  but ferrie was the craziest
nobody knows what were talking about jack

oh my god i cant tell you how nervous ive been i couldnt sleep last night

shes probably smash you in the fucking face
yeah
i want to knock her guard down i mean theres a whole philosophy behind it having a virgin suck your dick thats basic because theres nothing lost
yeah i feel dehydrated
right
yep
he looks like my uncle
oh you like her
darcy
yeah
yeah
how are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day that shits gotta be against the law
what are you talking about

yeah i was gonna write a book but i cant spell
i knew he wouldnt want to speak to me that dick
and you feel like youre being ripped open inside
dont go anywhere stay with me
no i just gotta go find him
i dont know just some messy little scrap you know that bullshit
whah is dissdee
because he can like climax you up to that
have you ever swallowed it before
making love is like
yeah fifteen minutes to a half an hour hard and deep
did they ask you a lot of questions
holy shit thats all true
but then i wont need your money
shh
when are you gonna be back
paul its telly open up
nothing we just wanted to come by and see what you were up to
its very monotonous
and we were like underneath the sheets we were going at it like crazy oh my god that shit was so good it was like hard
yeah
come on steven hook me up do me this solid  come on man i gotta get darcy alone shes gonna let me fuck her man please
it means if i were a killer and i thought the police were closing in on me i might invent someone to try and put them off the scent
no
his victims arent random  it only means that they appear to be random theres a connection we just have to find it
i wouldnt know
howd you get in here
i used to  with my old man  he taught me how to hunt and trap  trappings a lot harder than most people think  we used to go after raccoons mostly theyd get into our garbage our fields  when an animal cant live peacefully with those around it it has to be destroyed  but theyre crafty little devils  you see the trick is you can put your trap down but no raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent  you ever smell raccoon scent  smells like shit but to a male raccoon it smells just like pussy  hell walk right up to that trap even though it dont look nothing like a raccoon and stick his goddam head right in it  you know why  cause he cant help himself  the scent drives him  so if you want to catch a raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is  lay down the scent  and sooner or later hell walk right into the trap
i was at the beach
im positive
get off me
youre right i cant make you do it besides youre probably gonna be too busy with the franchise tax board anyway
local
im sorry this is just too convenient
anything
ive seen a lot of things in my time on the job but nothing like this yurilivich
ive got a feeling were going to go the distance with him  let him sweat for a little while
hes one of the best chess players in the world  who better to play a game with
he was with me
thats something youll have to figure out for yourself  really peter you cant expect me to answer such direct questions
youre not going to tell me that
do you know what im doing right now peter  im looking at the name of the girl im going to kill tonight
i know what i said  she looks just like
i really wish youd stop trying to maneuver me  i find it irritating not to mention insulting
please i dont want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions it would detract from the game
so is mine within the framework of my rules
you like to brag dont you
you sonofabitch
if you kill tonight and im in jail the police will know im innocent
the games over  you lost
no  as usual youre wrong  it is her i want  killing you would be easy living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat
i think your mother knows that now why dont you put the knife down  put it down david
oh i put a few games on for your daughter  i hope you dont mind
im just nervous  sorry
why did he what
youre losing me
he went down to the lobby for a minute he should be right back  would you like come in
not really  its pretty boring
how do you know that  did he say something
i cant sleep  my beds lumpy
okay
mrs lutz  she also told me that mr lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great grandmasters in the spirit world
not much  theres no sign of a break in  i think she let him in
bingo
and this jeremy
call dispatch  double the patrols  i want that area blanketed
what does that mean
she called to give me my schedule for tomorrow
we think he might be making a reference to drugs  miss emma is a street term used by junkies for morphine
is  did you tell him about the institute
he uses castlesplural   then says cant move me  singular  not cant move us
he knows youre aware of that
no
hi sara  this is doctor sheppard  i was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called principals and tactics by anton berger
not really  you see your goal and you go after it  anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed
each circumstance requires a different tactic
does whats going on bother you at all or are you just wearing your game face
this isnt a game
of course
i think its best if we dont ask too many personal questions  i want to keep things on a professional level
i just wanted to know if youre involved with anyone  let me ask you something  do your colleagues know if youre involved or not
why
youre not
how the hell can i relax after seeing what i just saw
you know andy thinks youre doing this
because i think hes wrong
no  you were talking about chess
and you
have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games
then show me who you are
then why are you backing up
admit what  that i was right about you in the steam room  that youre willing to do anything to find out what you want  would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room
for emphasis
can i come in
i want someone i can get close to i dont know if thats possible with you
no listen  you have no idea of the kind of pressure im under right now
its not that easy
but i do
im sure you are
oh that  i know what you mean  i had nightmares all week
thats worse
colwyn 
i know it
colwyn colwyn  i love you colwyn
but there is another entrance to this place
he has come for lyssa
you are young you dont understand the attraction of great power and you forget the pain of long waiting
he sees betrayal everywhere he will attack us so long as he is conscious
youre coming with us
no you cannot know that
yes
yes
i cannot take comfort when she has none
you will not then
a forest near the valley of needles
perhaps he expected to eat it
you and i will guard the fire
hah you dont know me boy
to the place where death lives
that i promise you
they do not exist except in the waters of the swamp where they will remain
what kind of friend do you think i am
well it is true that if i received a royal command i couldnt very well disobey it could i
at the gallop
subject to the king no doubt
would you settle for a boar
me  may i eat with you tonight
and mine goes with you
id wish for a puppy
i only want one
you had better manners as a pig
surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison
oh my poor stomach
the one with red eyes was a dark one the other was a cyclops and it was not you he meant to kill
he will not come you will be my queen
the attacks are unceasing by night the dark ones by day those of our people who have sold themselves to them those traitors who are called the slayers
modred has treated with the dark ones
that i am my lady
with an old voice
her name is death
its a hundred leagues from here
no she was not as beautiful
you said nothing you told me nothing
power you have given me what can my power give you
no
then the other lyssa will share your fate she will grow old in the fortress as you have grown old here
there is sand enough for only one life go now save the other
huh i see but this is the fbi little girl and i cant let you in  but if you leave me his money ill give him it myself
no not yet  hes very shy and very sensitive
not at all
what for example
quick doesnt mean ready and you cant discuss we said right
of course so kiss me quickly or theyll notice us
that wasnt bullshit i said we love each other
a little
yeah theres a lot on tv
youve just to love me and ill be the happiest woman around

the system would collapse

you shouldnt  you shouldnt trust anyone certainly not the attorney general who wants it all for himself  not the young federal agent who wants your job  not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what hes created  dont trust anyone  just find the minority report

he has imputed to me conduct unworthy a senatorand i demand he be made to yield the floor
the gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his state he has been waiting as he so fancifully puts it for them to come marching here in droves would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say

in the desert what for

you shall see
intestines
to have stopped this creature yes
 then perhaps the golden book of the living can return them to the underworld
yes no one has ever had so much been so close we must stop her or it will be the end of us all
forget the bumbling americans they will be like all the others without the map to guide them how can they possibly find hamunaptra
according to the ancients cats are the guardians at the gates of the underworld imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated and then he will fear nothing
for them to protect it like this you just know theres got to be treasure down there
water turning to blood
what did you do to him

right right in a big underground treasure chamber everybody knows the story the entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand on pharaohs command a flick of the switch and the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes

the most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced twenty years ago they were casanovas personal bodyguard but after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork
shhh
are you serious this is the break weve been waiting for
then maybe its time for us to form our own brotherhood a brotherhood of righteous crime fighting skull cracking disco boy bashing warriors of the night
oh shut up
no
hey hes gone
were superheroes
usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill in his case its entirely emotional
of course im such a fool thanks mummy
because im a superhero
who are they
shut up
with or without him we gotta go
through there
i am in no position to debate this with you your majesty but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the emperor if you should now desert his cause  it would mean nothing less than victory for england
i have given a great deal of thought to that possibility and i am prepared to face it  if it should come to war and i presume that is what you are alluding to i would rather have war with the emperor than my own people
i have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation the terms are not established
proceed
rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything  however it doesnt affect what we are talking about  please go on
for the sake of your argument let us say that is correct
ah yes  proceed
perhaps it would be even more serious than that your majesty his european confederation is held together by some very slender threads  your majesty knows even better than i that austria and prussia are very doubtful allies and the emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him at the first sign of weakness
whatever suggested the idea to you
i did sir
no thank you
things are quite serious i should say
what do you have in mind
any cannon
where are they
you could have them here by daybreak
it is on this road sire following me
paris is evacuated sire  the enemy is to enter at nine oclock tomorrow morning  the national guard is on duty at the gates
unhappily it is true sire
who sent my wife and son out of paris
and where is joseph
that is incredible
no sire i was asleep
let me see it
yes sir
no sir none at all
you dont know many of citizen barras friends do you
four oclock
the first reports came in at about ten
from what we can tell there are hundreds of agents all over the city  the combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand and all the fireengines have been removed from the city
but my dear duroc how can i act without guidance from vienna  i havent the slightest idea of how the emperor francis might feel about this
i fear our meeting is long overdue napoleon
ah well that is the first rule of warfare  you must wear longsleeved and longlegged underwear  you can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom
yes i am sir
oh im sorry about that
you know i am only too happy to be of help to you but surely this isnt the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters
i have no idea  her maid said she left two days ago to meet me  i can imagine where she is  but when she finally does come home she will find her things in the street and my door locked
my dear joseph the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut  and while a man may want a slut for his mistress he does not want her for his wife
i am delighted to be of service to you again your highness  and i can tell you my instructions came directly from the emperor with a caution to be discreet
and you seem in excellent health your highness
of course
yes
not in the least  after all what is adultery  only a brief transaction on a couch requiring a few minutes of privacy
i dont understand you
promises mean nothing
yes
oh my darling  im sorry too  i wont do that again  whatever you do  i wont cause you any more embarrassment i promise
you know that letter you showed me in milan  the one about hippolyte charles
yes of course  what do you want
and was it so widely known that joseph had reason for such concern
ah you must forgive me my dearest marielouise i saw it during one of my stays at your palace  at schonbrunn
you are much younger and much more handsome than your pictures
i am sure you will enjoy the french countryside
i only desire what gives you pleasure my dearest
i did not ask her to go to war against me
that is correct
we have a treaty with austria
what you are talking about is a gamble on moderation  when i gamble i prefer to gamble on force
monsieur varlac i will count slowly to five and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then i will carry out your execution on the spot
my mother has always loved me  she would do anything for me
life is a burden for me  nothing gives me any pleasure i find only sadness in everything around me  it is very difficult because the ways of those with whom i live and probably always shall live are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight
it will scarcely be considered credible perhaps but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together
why you say that
thank you  i only got two bullets in the mothafucka but its better than nothing
ill do it
not me
come on day try it  for moms
if you say another word its over  im not playing

if we say that leon well be sent to siberia

or a tunnel or a bridge
and thank you for getting me up here ive never seen this before beautiful isnt it
please dont misunderstand me
now i didnt say that either naturally nothing would please me more
thank you ive had all the calories necessary for today
for mankind not a thing  for womankind the record is not quite so bleak
ninotchka
youre the most improbable creature ive ever met in my life ninotchka ninotchka
its false sentimentality
oh my barbaric ninotchka my impossible unromantic statistical
but one of your friends may be in need of you you must answer
all right fight me fight me as much as you want but fight me tomorrow morning theres nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy
send me a plate of raw carrots and beets beets predominating on a ratio of sixtyforty what there is a strike in the kitchen good will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause i hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables what you wont serve me either now look here comrade i think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me youre weakening the people
then how did you get here
what are you after
what
at what
i dont think so
leon i want to tell you something which i thought i never would say which i thought nobody ever should say because i thought it didnt exist and leon i cant say it
i dont think so
a funny story
they are all duchesses here thousands of duchesses and i am going to tell them
all right well make it red
yes a kiss salute
much happier
no no news we dont want to know whats happening in the world we want to be left alone dont we
the one i got they wouldnt let me read  it began ninotchka my darling and ended yours leon
if you dont stay with me ill have to continue my fight ill travel wherever russian commissions are ill turn them all into buljanoffs iranoffs and kopalskis the world will be crowded with russian restaurants ill depopulate russia once you saved your country by going back this time you can save it by staying here
youd be surprised how many nice people dine with the guizots
i understand how you feel but there is a limit to everything particularly pride and dignity they are willing to pay any price they have a circulation of two million
yes im your little volga boatman
was i no not by a bolshevik
not in your condition  make it tepid gaston tepid and tender and lay out his gray suit  afterwards ill drive you through the bois slowly in waltz time
you cant imagine
is this your new dress suit
im the one who should apologize i should have talked to you before
yes
do you expect me to believe that
just in case they dont give you your visa to russia i want you to know that i have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chteau in the touraine and if you feel the need of a change
if you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night i am afraid you misunderstood my attitude
i must ask you to leave
people cannot be taken away madame neither a hundred and sixty million nor one not if you have their love you hadnt thats why youre not in russia any longer and thats why you came here this morning
it is not enough to be witty madame people grow tired of being entertained you made that mistake before problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony
dont worry fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a russian  i just put this on for sentiment the rest are absolutely safe i assure you but if you feel like notifying the police
thats not the way to win him back not leon
yes leaving immediately
this will do 
but madame if you dont think about food what do you think about
my jewels
why do you bring this up after so many years
where the hell is he
no  his office  i want a very private conversation  i dont want to be bugged
siricas just trying to force one of them to testify  but theyre solid
what
uh huh 
i mean who the hell cares about this pennyante shit  goldwater put it right  he said well for christs sake everybody bugs everybody else we know that  its the coverup not the deed thats really bad here  if only mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it give them the hors doeuvre and maybe they wont come back for the main course  thats the tragedy of all this  mitchells going to get it in the neck anyway its time he assumed some responsibility
good  you know how i feel about loyalty  im not going to let any of my people go to jail  that i promise you  the important thing is to keep this away from haldeman and ehrlichman im trusting you to do that john  i have complete confidence in you
in richard nixons long history of underhanded dealings he has never gotten better value for his money  if i were to open my mouth all the dominoes would fall
im one of his people  the cubans are his people  and were going to jail for him
john sooner or later  sooner i think  you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to richard nixon  that hes the darkness reaching out for the darkness  and eventually its either you or him look at the landscape of his life and youll see a boneyard
how so
the old man plays politics harder than anybody else
jesus  did mitchell know
he left his white house phone number in his hotel room
sir theres dead american kids here lets say we dont apologize for kent state but maybe we could have a national prayer day 
yeah good old spiro  well better him than me  what the hell is he but an insurance policy
no no  hes our only star right now  hed go crying straight to the press  hed crucify us  the sonofabitch  get someone from our staff on his ass tap his phones  i want to know everyone he talks to
and what am i supposed to do  just sit here and watch them coming closer eating their way to the center  lyndon bugged  so did kennedy  fdr cut a deal with lucky luciano christ even ike had a mistress whats so special about me  what about lyndon  he could make a couple of calls to the hill and shut this whole thing down  did anyone talk to him
mr hoover was a realist
you know al men in your profession  you give em a pistol and you leave the room
thats what theyre doing
we were working on china
our own intelligence capability  to fix the leaks
no keep trini out of this chotiners too old  and for gods sake keep colson out  its time to baptize our young counsel  that means dean can never talk about it  attorneyclient privilege  get to it  and dean  you stay close on this
you approved that before the fact because i went over it with you  but 
all right
hell need a pretext  hell never figure one out for himself
ill talk to helms  oh pat asked if youre coming to the residence for dinner tonight
what  that he knew johnny roselli hoover knew a lot of gangsters
they had us bugged  christ he had everybody bugged  yeah he was gonna support me in 68 but he was also threatening me  that was hoover hed give you the carrot but hed make damn sure the stick went right up your ass
i tell you the soldiers were provoked  now stop this pussyfooting around  dead kids  how the hell did we ever give the democrats a weapon like this  i mean if cambodia doesnt work well bomb hanoi if we have to
yeah weve got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit  thats top priority
sir
wait till the maitais wear off
my god my god  he talked to the new york times
what about the documents he promised
why me
please mother it  it was just one time mother im  im sorry
then this shall be our little secret  remember that i see into thy soul as god sees  thou may fool the world even thy father  but not me richard never me
thou must
id rather get a whipping than have another talk with her  anything but a talk with her
what  
firing you mr helms wouldnt do any good  of course youll continue as dci  youre doing a magnificent job
what
my job unpleasant sometimes is to know what others dont want me to know
it is not my practice to spy on the president  doctor kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own
edgar think twice  he works in the kitchen
im trying to spare you an embarrassment  johnny roselli is on his way back here
a guy named gordon liddy  thinks hes martin borman  you wanna meet him
just dont tell him to do anything you dont really want him to do
a warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk nietzsche
remember  listen up  fire team discipline is there at all times keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration  check yourselves  phony ids no wallets no keys  we rendezvous where  the watergate room 214  when  at zero threehundred
anything goes wrong head for your homes just sit tight  youll hear from me or howard

he was he was  we taught a class together at harvard  but you know these backstabbing ivy league intellectuals they cant 
finally someone whos noticed  im a great admirer of yours too mr nixon  you are an unusual politician we share a mutual idol  six crises sounds like a page from churchill
we have to entertain the possibility 
jews and negros dont win elections henry  better to hang them around the democrats necks
but it must be done your government is paralyzed
yes  my mother used to pray  a lot  its been a long time since i really prayed  lets pray henry lets pray a little
not at all  this is not going to leak is it
that was mr kennedy
you know this kinda thing you gotta be brutal  a leak happens the whole damn place should be fired  really you do it like the germans in world war ii  if they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them theyd line the whole goddamned town up and say until you talk youre all getting shot  i really think thats what has to be done  i dont think you can be mr niceguy anymore 
talks all day too  how the hell can you put up with her john
the jewboys a harvard whore with the morals of an eel  sells himself to the highest bidder
you need her dick  in 60 she was worth five six million votes

ive made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates
and you want to turn pirate yourself
how  the keys run off

i havent set foot off dry land since i was twelve when the ship i was on exploded  its been a sound policy
i worked passage from england as a cabin boy  after my mother passed i came out here  looking for my father

a man
this day just keeps going from bad to worse
because i am a new man susan  i am a man of vision  your problem susan is that youre always looking down  if youd just look up youd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost  they focus on what can be gained

dont say that readings my salvation
youll hate me now wont you
its not even noon 
im not a beautiful young prospect ripe for corruption
what did you do bribe one of the guards
its not even a proper novel its nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions frankly it even fails as an exercise in craft the characters are wooden the dialogue is inane not to mention the endless repetition of words like nipple and pikestaff 
but we also fall in love we build cities we compose symphonies and we endure why not put that in your books as well
one more trick like this and ill be forced to revoke all your liberties
more than your writings at stake the ministry has threatened us with closure
his rug
coulmier you animal
your wig remove your wig
your words drove bouchon to 
youre no stranger to rape marquis and yet with her you cooed you courted you begged
why was it you never took her by force
then it mustve been love 
this may feel a tad awkward my friend but it neednt be ive merely come to oversee your work here understood
it seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy
i hope youll judge him by his progress here and not his past reputation
playing dressup with cretins that sounds like a symptom of madness not its cure
do you favor its publication
all france is aghast at this book yet youve not heard of it
and place my reputation at stake
hes sworn to obedience
oh indeed
its a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children 
he was so impressed with the marquis tale that he chose to reenact it yes
a word of caution sire we all remember what happened to robespierre danton and marat put the marquis to death and history might even regard you as a despot
im afraid so hes an idealist youll have to be politic
i dont shed tears over the past monsieur delben i look to the future
maybe someday youll tell me your name
sweet then like the pastry
nows not the time to be cheeky maddy
its because of the marquis isnt it
is it terribly erotic
the climax comes at a higher cost you must sit on my lap
whats that then
its only been described to me in your books
youre far crueler than i my sweet
first and foremost hes a man you remind him of that fact and he resents you for it
what shall i ready asked fanchon my mouth my ass or my succulent oyster
oh you do do you it is my dearest hope doctor that he remain entombed forever and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms
i pay his stipend every month far more dutifully than i should
its beyond perversity that honor should carry a price tag
theyve put you up to this havent they
no when i was but a tender lad
he needs me here
and he did
the character thats supposed to be me susan alexander
my name is orson welles
to make pictures
over at rko
you know that cant happen
why is that louis
darling i talked to millicent
how much

whats he know
yeah  sure
okay mr radeau its forgot
you can
mr august im not at all sure 
you think my sister is there
can we go there now
if my sisters in that room it wont make any difference about warrants and things i want to go there
you could go and open the door
yes i understand
if jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself
what sort of danger
she could use a hundred dollars
shes nervous naturally under the circumstances
i dont know thats why i came to see mrs redi im trying to find her
but i like teaching school
then you know where jacqueline is
why
werent you afraid
but you do believe me
he was a kind little man in his way  and i made him go down that hall into the darkness i made him do it
maybe the romaris might have a room they seem nice
last night in this very restaurant mr jason hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear
a poet hes sitting right over there thats his table  the one at the feet of dante
weve tried so long to find her
any court in the land would understand well wait a few days  let you rest  then well go to the police
gregory   youd better take jacqueline with you tonight
it may make very fine poetry mr hoag but it doesnt make good sense
verse  verse that i wrote i need it
im afraid
why wait
goodbye
yes and now that ive shown you that i know that much and can guess more  will you trust me to look for jacqueline
its beautiful  that searchlight  the stars 
jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man
i have to it was irving august  everything mrs redi said  it fits in with what i saw  she even knew id seen his body on the subway
hes jacquelines husband i cant
bella romariif i were not seated i would embrace you in three movements like a sonata  ah my wonderful one fly with me tonight we will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies
she was my patient
ive lost my knack
it goes beyond that it praises the goodness of god and the greatness of all his works
tell me what
perhaps
you know where she is
it seems right to us
i always thought it was a more intimate relationship
youre even sentimental about it what made you change your mind
im afraid not
giacomo  la bellisslina madonna 
what
we havent even begun tea yet
yes jacqueline you were always talking suicide   of ending your life when you wanted to
television
are you uncomfortable with my appearance
anyway i think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned
yes i was surprised that he accepted when i asked if i could stay here until i found a place
i knew him very well we were extremely close until i dropped out
whats the first
how do you mean
i feel like they do
right right i dont feel connected to many people either other than john
its up to you but i warn you if you tell me something personal i might do the same
i dont know he just said he wants to wait i quit asking
agreed
i am selfconscious but not in the same way that you are you have got to be the most attractive self conscious person ive ever seen
hah no im not actually i used to be but the therapist i had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems of course i lied to him constantly so i guess i cant hold him totally responsible
you had sex with you therapist
whos donna
maybe you want to go
what would you know about a normal frame of mind
what do you have to do to get ready
then do it
i have money
ann bishop millaney
do you want me to stop
are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about
so what happened was it so bad that it turned you off
im babbling
yeah i know but somehow i expect that from her i mean shell do it with almost anybody i dont know i shouldnt stick up for her i guess but him he lied so deeply ooo i want to watch him die
but i dont understand 
no ann i cant i cant forget it its not something i can fix its difficult there s something in my mind the way my brain works  god ann when youre with another person and youre inside them youre so vulnerable youre revealing so much theres no protection and somebody could say or do something to you while youre in this state of nakedness and they could hurt you without even knowing it in a way that you couldnt even see  and you would withdraw to make sure it didnt happen again
you did that
whod you have lunch with
if im right i want to know i dont want you to lie id be very upset but not as upset as if id found out youd been lying
i want out of this marriage
well call it uncontested or whatever i just want out
yes
yes
not very often
nothing i mean nothing i try not to do anything that will produce garbage so obviously were talking about eating and basic stuff like that did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day
dont you think thats a lot of garbage id really like to know where its all going to go
well this weekend john was taking out the garbage and he kept spilling things out of the container and i started imagining a container that grew garbage like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself and how could you stop that if it started happening
well do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are i mean maybe they do but i doubt those people are in therapy besides being happy isnt all that great my figure is always at its best when im depressed the last time i was really happy i put on twentyfive pounds i thought john was going to have a stroke
oh yeah  but see ive never really been into sex that much i mean i like it and everything it just doest freak me out i wouldnt miss it you know but anyway lately we havent been doing anything at all like i said its not that i miss it but im curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden
did you masturbate
i take it youve never masturbated
no i havent
the friend of johns that was staying at your house
is he still at your house
ive been thinking about it for awhile and then i was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me
not really
why
what the hell happened over there did he make a pass at you
then whats the story whats this strange bullshit all of a sudden is he drowning puppies or what
did he ask you to take your clothes off
cynthia
you dont know that for sure
did he touch you
i cant believe you did that
i mean i couldnt do that in front of john even
so hes got this catalogue of women touching themselves that doesnt make you feel weird
i dont want to discuss it
no
okay
bye
im cynthia bishop
you want me to leave
she still is
not exactly
talking
i just want to ask you questions
just a moment
when i was fourteen
he said that my hand felt good
how about if you record over the one we already made you could have the same date and not use another tape who would know
no i mean doing it at my house
in here
you know what i mean
i want to see you
then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here
right
it just wasnt a smart thing to do did you sign any sort of paper or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldnt broadcast these tapes
you realize you have no recourse legally this stuff could show up anywhere
what do you mean
graham
no  you said threefifty
you were prying before
or go someplace in a hurry
i need help whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes graham not me buddy youre the fucking nut now show me those tapes

you better get in there with her until this thing is over
he says he doesnt care about anything but he does theres just no telling what its going to be
i am telling the truth
you dont have to protect my feelings simone  i dont blame viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world
it sounds like you still have feelings for him
i dont know how many times i have to say this elaine but viktor and i are not in love  i only make love to the camera
im glad we talked
 illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth
spare me
i dont know if thats going to happen
as i say shes something of a recluse  thats how shes able to stay so pure  by isolating herself in her art
there arent any  if the filmmakers are happy simones happy  she considers herself an instrument
shell do her own  theater training
ill send you her resume
which accounts for your percentage  when do i get to meet this dream
soon  soon
oh make it live  please viktor
no  shell never work again  retire never make a movie or a record or appear ever again
not if i dont let her
every actor is an invention viktor  dont embarrass yourself no ones denying that you discovered simone  but its like finding a diamond in the desert anyone can trip over it but its not the finder who sparkles
right beside you  i borrowed viktors car
elaine do you realize you cant stop talking about viktor
of course
please put your clothes on
what exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects

not exactly  it exists in a continuum that wasnt proven until ten years ago a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the universe an infinite number of them in fact it was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the universe space or spacetime  it was completely counterintuitive  we had to unlearn everything
youre talking about a man in a white beard again  youre ascribing human characteristics to something that isnt human  human beings look for causes and patterns  how could we know what solaris is up to if anything
well  he doesnt think its god but for different reasons than me hes thinking if i can figure out how to make it stop than i am smarter than it is and therefore it cannot be god
yes  especially toward the end
its all right
you should have told me
i never said i didnt
i want you here
i want to stop taking those pills
they do something to me  its hard to think straight
i cant 
please  dont
why do you say that
are the actions of solaris premeditated
gibarian was helpless  its very simple man created the science that resulted in the discovery of solaris and the ship that brought us here
you go ahead  of what i remember about earth its all one thing now  everythings a blur  i like distinctions

soran doesnt care about power or weapons all he cares about is getting back to the nexus
i am on the enterprise i am also here  think of me as an echo of the person you know a part she left behind

a spaceship with a missing man
permission granted
jim spock jim remember
to the onboard computer room to confirm my suspicion
that would be futile admiral the probe would neutralize us easily
judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere i believe we have arrived at the late 20th century
where would we find these reactors theoretically
and they will be again spock thats the beauty of it  how much
spock dont call me admiral dont you remember you used to call me jim now whats your question

they are my friends
gomen nasarei hito chigai de gozaranuka na  im sorry my son you have mis taken me for someone else
arigato sayonara  thank you honorable sir
its not our custom to have guests here at all let alone hold anyone against their will
your directive apparently doesnt include spying on other cultures
ive been shot at thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship thats come to abduct us all whats there to panic about
weve just begun to  i suppose youre seventyfive
but not you
this is a school thats a students work  shell be ready to become an apprentice soon then in thirty or forty years shell take her place among the artisans
yes exactly nothing more complicated than perception  you explore the universe weve discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself full of powerful forces most people arent aware enough of the now to ever notice them
 an offlander
youve brought the federation into the middle of a blood feud admiral the children have returned to expel their elders just as they were once expelled except ruafos need for revenge has now escalated to parricide
my power cells continually re charge themselves
but i can run much faster than you i am capable of exceeding fortyseven meters per second
androids dont havefun
no ones ever asked me that before
data doesnt breathe
and our people
yewcheen cheffaw my collar size is exactly the same as it was at the academy
from the mission
how about a passive radiation scan
it is clearly federation in origin captain
in six hours every living thing in this system will be dead or dying
who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people
a planet in federation space
someone probably said the same thing about the romulans a century ago
then the sona can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do
if we could lure him away from the bridge
sir as the enterprise left orbit one of their support craft went down to the surface  it appeared to be the captains yacht five persons on board
why would they fire at him without provocation
so youre saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong
and yet he attacked us and told the baku we were a threat
its nothing im just tired
how long til they reach us
so where are the environmental concerns the admiral was talking about
go back to your quarters  thats an order
jeanluc picard my officers doctor crusher and counselor troi
well skip the court martial this time picard out
worf what the hell are you doing here
accelerated hair growth is often experienced by klingons during jaktahla
very well well take an hour break out some rations
decloak the holoship and engage a tractor beam mister worf
can you beam him off
say the greeting again
they have an incredible clarity of perception captain ive never encountered a species with such mental discipline
hmm i should feel right at home with them
got a minute i need a little counseling  first time for everything do i lie down or what
on this ship anything can happen and usually does
mister data set a pursuit course maximum warp
its been destroyed the borg threat is over  are you all right the enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment
montana well that answers everything why the hell are we 
yes
im afraid so if the borg succeed in preventing first contact with the vulcans earth will remain in the second dark age an easy target when the borg arrive in the 24th century
im saying they might shoot us on sight you have to remember these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them
lets hope so because if cochrane dies the future may die with him
id call them excuses and the first excuse on both our lists was our sense of duty we convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else and you know what its not
im a little worried about some of these bone fragments if they move any closer to the brain we could be looking at a hemorrhage
have they given you what i have given you did they even try
a universe of sensation is waiting for you dont you want to explore it with me
then take the final step give me the enterprise and we can be together always
ready quantum torpedo
i am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before as an android i am in complete control of my neural net the information contained there cannot be forcibly removed
i am the borg
i am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming grief loss remorse
doctor crusher has been studying some advanced medical theories
oh just a little tinkering how is he
if there are other photographs i think i may know how to find them
get a tricorder youre going to have to track my exact position in that room
bring the warp core online ill lay in a heading
im on it
picard to enterprise  picard to enterprise  do you read me
were crossing the threshold
california san francisco
im an old friend of cochranes i wanted to see how he was doing
yes
the invasion plans
these people youre calling vulcans who are they where do they come from how many troops what kind of weapons
i can try
too bad  besides itll give you all night to think up a new set of lies
myself and a few other friends of zephrams
a key piece of the ship has been destroyed and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like
aye sir
steady as she goes
life signs
unless youd like to stay
assign another team if you need to i want to reestablish communication with the captain as soon as possible
what
it appears that someone has taken over the environmental control room
they appear to be modifying the deflector dish
understood
nothing
any sign of data or the borg themselves
something is very wrong commander were falling back
target
vulcans sleep lying down
thank you nurse jim shes ready lock and load
chancellor gorkon can you hear me chancellor
i didnt mean this future
that cunning little vulcan
killed trying to escape  its a classic
in space no one can hear you sweat
we were until your torpedoes
the chancellor herself will testify that the defendants hands shook
you feign ignorance
yes
yes
full diplomatic courtesy mr chekov
but if shes cloaked
shields up battle stations
aye sir thrusters
aye sir thrusters
they must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here
she programmed the torpedo hits
onscreen
starfleets been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres all vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors
we must do this again soon
give a girl a chance captain
where do we come in
you piloted well out of spacedock lieutenant 
uhura signal our surrender
i wont allow starfleet to be dismantled over some klingon promises
you understand that by even talking to us youre violating regulations captain
theres an old vulcan proverb only nixon could go to china
theyre dying
far be it for me to dispute my first officer starfleet has always 
he was just about to explain the whole damn 
such things have happened before sir
you cant prove any of this
signal starfleet that we have no idea location of enterprise
visual
mr scott you forget yourself please accompany me
yet the data banks insist we fired twice one computer is lying
nevertheless
then someone forged a data bank entry
i know precisely where hell be
hes placing himself in a most awkward position
what exactly does that mean
i was taken from my homeworld by people called the pakjeds they are fat they traded me to a ship belonging to the bolians the bolians are blue they put me in a seat and asked me questions then they were attacked by another ship
no
i know
how long is that
he was a bit proud as i recall
is he very much like you were
that was another time
i understand why it would seem confusing certain human rituals like weddings birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions these rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time
thank you data  lets see what she can do
good work the download
of you
i do not agree although you share the same genetic structure the events of your life have created unique individual
he would deny a human connection is possible he considers himself entirely reman
commander riker evasive maneuvers
you are not looking at your self you are looking at me
hed have all your memories too you feel comfortable with that
an individual more like you you mean
dont give up hope data i know i know youre not capable of hope
with pleasure captain
youre speaking of emotional investment
as much as we care for him deanna we have to remember that data isnt capable of disappointment
how could i not
counselor
this isnt about me anymore
you sick bastard
i can feel your desire deanna
set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting if it happens again we want to be ready
what if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack
on screen
not with the romulans
wont do what mister worf
what sort of signature
on screen
who was it
a coup detat
its an old psychological strategy number one to put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy
away team transporter room four
his hatred of the federation is apparent he would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason he is going after earth
when your first officer insists that you cant go on away missions ignore him
ive never met a human woman
and the senate supports you
yes
you know i do
what happened
youll acquire a taste for it
why am i here

setting up technically anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address but by using punters a correspondent literally punts his address around the world through computers in countries that have no communication treaties the correspondent becomes ghosted invisible
thats the beauty of the system this is a fugitive chat room it moves from place to place chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours a gardening website chaucer buffs a dating service a pre arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms  thats where i stumbled across it  notifying friends to meet at a certain time usually midnight to three eastern standard at a certain website  a deserted chat room say how to plant perennials come tuesday twelve am bingo these likeminded deviates log on and start yakking it up explicit sex crime gossip who did what to whom who wants to do what when why and how
me too  make any headway with zorro
i know
does koessler ask about me
not about coming to see daitz
i cant they trust me they accept me ive got their confidence
you want to get him find something he wants get him to come to you

low calls him suspect zero
thats what koessler wants us to believe to discredit low
im going to amarillo
kulok
the little piggie speaks
ive been reading hearing about you i spoke to koessler professor daitz
deputy director koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope risking highprofile failure better to get rid of me then he could be mr serial killer mr authority on deviant behavior  no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one richard low do you really think that plane crashed by accident do you really think i wasnt on it by accident ive always had a good sense of intuition

good morning
georgina told me how kind you were to her  it gave me hope you might intercede for us with dr macfarlane

ive never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man

therere no cars on this street
when we first met when you were 7 where was the house you lived in with your mother do you remember your address

of course our pledge can be relayed to any government official secretary khruschev sees fit to satisfy
somebody had to say it i respect adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser
hes right and things are happening too fast it smells like the bay of pigs all over again
then talk to your brother goddamn it the two of you dont need any advice to get into trouble
he better because nobody thinks hes up to this nobody
 jesus mary and joseph i told you how stupid it was to float the lippman article but you wouldnt listen to me what if there hasnt been a coup at all what if its you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade
cuba

time is of the essence
mccones been notified and is coming back from the west coast carters here though
we are not at war sir not until were at defcon 1

from the data  and from that picture the air force took earlier tonight    what weve got in the gully out there is a guide ship  one lands  others follow later  they appear to clear an area then drop in groups of threes joined magnetically  is that possible
thats because we want a chance to observe them  this is the only place weve had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them  what happens here will be a guide to all other operations the minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops ill get my report to washington  youve deployed your forces well

what after giving us such a run around
yes fairly well but i went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things  instead i fell asleep
and you say that came from lisca bianca
look id like to get back to lisca bianca
but even here we were supposed to find who knows what and all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes
how should i be  arrogant
yes i had also thought of going there to talk with them
i think the only way to help ourselves claudia is for us to be together
yes but its all so conflicting however there is some slight indication
are you joking
oh sandro im so ashamed of myself so ashamedi tried to hide myselfi feel so small i hate myself 
and are you sure you want to marry me are you really surethat you want to marry me
why
yes she started to but i didnt feel like staying to listen to what she had to say if we had to listen to everybody
sleep is something one must learn to overcome i learned how to do it when i was a child i never slept and i had friends who even slept less than i did the one who went to bed first paid a penalty and we really didnt do anything after seeing a movie wed go to a cafe and discuss things for a while then wed sit down on a bench somewhere listen to some drunkard watch them putting up posters or manifestoesor look at the sheep passing by or go for a stroll around the market place or else wed go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name
you say that just to flatter me
i imagine he must be inside sleeping
more or less we are all afraid especially at night
but for what reason should i come there
but why all nudes
i detest comparisons made with oil
really so that you can stuff it with your geraniums
so the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers could it be possible then that anna
listen marshal as for there being reasons for going away anyone of us might have three thousand of them so you can assume that she had them what i want to know is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard
what is it
i thought the model was something obsolete nowadays didnt you claudia
but i want to paint you you appeal to me more
i tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you
no not like this one
because this is a chinese radio
unfortunately no
look marshal with those deep crevasses youll need some rope and ladders

dell plot our location
thats what im going to do
yeah  two hours
martin would you run me an atmospheric
but functioning
well the sun just came up again and it seems the winds died down its as clear as a bell outside theres something i think you ought to see
what is it i cant 
you want to try
no i want to go in
take care
i think thats a pretty reasonable request
i have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin
a voice transmission
yeah
yeah okay  go ahead
jay weve got a problem  i was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability
yes i know what they make it out of so what  its food now  uyoureu eating it
we have to avoid injuring it  what we really need is some electric animal prods
machines screwed up i cant tell needles spinning all over the dial
all over the ship well have to check the charts to know for sure
i kind of like it
i hope not
meet us on the bridge  be careful  its uhugeu now
uhesu the only one that knows that
it wouldnt come
how could anything be indigenous to this asteroid  its dead
at least it cant get up here now
oh my god
good  thats good
im trying
we cant spare the personnel  weve got minimum takeoff capability right now  thats why chaz left us on board
oh god
is it armed
feast your eyes
sandy can you home in on that beam
you lead
how far
that creature sure must have considered it important using his last strength to draw it
i couldnt make it out  too much interference
sun will be down in a minute
itll yank him right off his feet if hes not expecting it  the line could get tangled in something
well have to trap it somehow  if we had a really strong piece of net we could bag it
we cant even radio for help the carrier wave wouldnt reach its destination till long after wed died and turned to dust  we are utterly absolutely alone  can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances  halfway across creation
lets get moving with this net
yeah
right  fire up all systems
sandy contact traffic control
engine room what happened
i agree  this is the single most important discovery in history
oh well you know me
well its obviously intentional some kind of attempt at communication maybe its a symbol that means something to them
tell you what martin  as soon as the engines fixed 
were coming up now open the outer lock door
chaz listen to me  weve broken every rule of quarantine  if we bring an organism on board we wont have a single layer of defense left
he went into the pyramid alone  we lost radio contact with him  when we pulled him out it was on his face it wont come off not without injuring him
is that its mouth
if we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship 
up one kilometer jay
weve got it up here  its trapped get up here fast
once we kill the thing we wont need the food any more  we can go straight into hypersleep  also it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies it may be fouling them all
right now lets keep it closed
whats that supposed to mean
here carry these
its stable it doesnt hurt to drop it
ill get you out of there
what can i do
its nothing doc  just a touch of indigestion something
thanks
better tell the boss
we figured on it being a magnetic anomaly but we ran a backtrace just to make sure
okay give me the numbers

just some coffee
almost four
whyd call me a killer
thats for tonight youre invited were having everyone up after the performance
its nothing of the kind lloyd loves me i love him
im in love with lloyd
you have no right to say such things
more plainly and more distinctly i have not come to new haven to see the play discuss your dreams or to pull the ivy from the walls of yale i have come to tell you that you will not marry lloyd  or anyone else  because i will not permit it
so does the history of the world for the past twenty years i dont enjoy putting it as bluntly as this frankly i had hoped that you would somehow have known  have taken it for granted that you and i
then if you wont get out ill have you thrown out
what of it
she never proved anything not a thing
very well i shall drop you and go on to the party i have no intention of missing it
and too many of them are produced
hear hear
its new margo but shes just as late as the old one
how nice
the air lines have clocks even if you havent i start shooting a week from monday  zanuck is impatient he wants me he needs me
eve id forgotten they grew that way
all the religions in the world rolled into one and were gods and goddesses isnt it silly suddenly ive developed a big protective feeling for her  a lamb loose in our big stone jungle
as of this moment youre six years old
it wont play
youve heard it about when i looked through the wrong end of a camera finder
i dont think thats funny
stagestruck kid shes a young lady  of qualities and ill have you know im fed up with both the young lady and her qualities studying me as if  as if i were a play or a set of blueprints how i walk talk think eat sleep
stop calling her a kid it so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which i would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges
so full of meaning fire and music
dont mix your metaphors
here we go
that word again i dont even know what it means
ill say
then what would be enough  if we were married
i think you do know but you wont or cant tell me  i said before it was going to be my last try and i meant it i cant think of anything else to do i wish i could  we usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down then it comes up again and everythings fine but not this time  you know there isnt a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people goodbye margo
groom
i just wondered
its only one picture deal
from what would i be running
im for it
when i told you what every young actress should know
no thanks birdie
i know she just keeps hearin her dead father play the banjo
imagine all this admiration in just one room
ohoh
do you want an argument or an answer
youre not being funny i could get actors for less what about the food
the only thing i ordered by mistake is the guests  theyre domestic too and they dont care what they drink as long as it burns wheres bill hes late
what for
ill just pick up the broken glass
hes the best
oh no i see the play
eve eve harrington
some hollywood movie star her plane got in late
of course
 and easy or not i wont believe a word
im not crying
if you told him so hed give me the part he said he would
every performance then  am i safe in assuming you like it
i was dreadful miss channing believe me  i have no right to be anyones understudy much less yours
of course it is
there are other plays
san francisco it was the last week i went one night the most important night in my life  until this one anyway i found myself going the next night  and the next and the next every performance then when the show went east  i went east
i could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time
quite sure i find it just a bit too  too seventeenish for me
it seems i cant think of a thing you havent thought of
yes i guess you were it  it was very thoughtful of you eve
why not
the heaveho
harrington
of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet
none in sight there arent many along this back road
well
lloyd says its a publicity release
youll be there wont you
the critics thought so the audiences certainly think so  packed houses tickets for months in advance  i cant see that either of lloyds last two plays have hurt you any
that book is out of print karen those days are gone fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets  they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches
of course she knew for one thing addison told her how superbly eve had read the part  karen let me tell you about eve shes got everything  a born actress sensitive understanding young exciting vibrant
 everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about until his play becomes a vehicle for miss channing
with gestures of course
now just a minute
margo
i doubt very much that youd like her in the hairy ape
too many and youve got a new guest a movie star from hollywood
not exactly sometimes though i wish i understood you better
twentyish it isnt important
how do you mean
week after week to thousands of people youre as young as you want
youd have been proud of her
she was a revelation
 in this case apparently as trustworthy as the world almanac
i mean really deeply angry
go ahead please
i aint gonna die not with a hit
the situation im in aint the kind you can belch your way out i made a promise
well
what have you been here nine monthsi been in this business since i was sixteen
you only got the job because both you and bradlee went to yale
mainly it has to do with your choice of words
you dowith access to records
for the paper no for us plenty  i waited a long time and finally this big guyi guess a bodyguard he left and i knocked and she remembered me we talked awhile
facts or theory
you believe in the president you wouldnt ever want to do anything disloyal
and im a republican
go on go on
then tomorrows grand jury indictments will just be bullshit
we will
nothingi just found out that jeb magruder from creep is a bigger bike freak than i am  i never like it when the other guys human
colson
shit
shit who do we know
haldeman i know who else
mitchell stans magruder kalmbach
who
hmm
so i guess you could say that we screwed up but we werent wrong
almost a year before he left the justice department
night
well of course
you cant
oh maybe nickel and dime stuff
i didnt
when you guys print it in the paper then ill know  im a lawyer and ill probably go to jail and be disbarred and what did i do that was so awful
it gets interesting if it was haldeman because our word is that when chapin says something hes gotten the ok from haldeman and when haldeman says something hes gotten the ok from the president
at usc you had a word the this screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking  ever wonder if nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all
where are your bills carl
lot of pressure at the star  carl when we got married you were four thousand dollars in debt when we split you were solvent that may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life and now look at this  how much did the damn bike cost
nobodys perfect  im glad youre out of it hannah youre a terrific reporter and i turned you into a bookkeeper
anyplace really public theyd know about itthey know everything at the committee carl
i dont know what theyd do to me
just let me get a match
no never in so many words
omigod there was so much of it six million came in one twoday period six million cash we couldnt find enough places to put it i thought it was all legal i guess i did til after the breakin when i remembered gordon got so much of it
do you think the truth will come out at the trial
to cover up
i will not talk about the other two
were moving  ive been looking for a job but its been hard my names been in the papers too much sometimes i wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence im not thinking of myself but my wife my parents its been very rough on them
thisll only take one second
its gotta be haldemansomeone from the white house had to be involved
let me put it this way id have no problem if you did
and well all have to go to work for a living
you saying the democrats bugged themselves
i dont know titles
mitchell started the coverup early everyone is involved in the cover up all the way to the top the whole us intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities the extent of it is incredible  and peoples lives are in danger maybe including ours
so
i have nothing more to say
youre definitely doing a story
that checks out with our finding thank you mr dahlberg
nothing thats the problemthe storys gone underground
to where
whats the whole thing aboutdo you know
liddyyou think theres a chance hell talk
i know what it meanssegretti wouldnt go on the record but if he would we know hed implicate chapin and that would put us inside the white house
do justice and the fbi know what we know and why the hell havent they done anything about it
mitchell knew then
total manipulation i suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the constitution but they dont think along philosophical lines
follow every leadevery lead goes somewhere
dont you miss the grand scheme too
youve done worse than let haldeman slip away youve got people feeling sorry for himi didnt think that was possible a conspiracy like this the rope has to tighten slowly around everyones neck you build from the outer edges and you go step by step if you shoot too high and miss then everybody feels more secure youve put the investigation back months
i think so
i couldnt say
well what if your boys get it wrong
i did all right on mccord
the head of security for the reelection of a republican president got caught bugging the national offices of the democrats what the hell does that mean
lotsa hints
i would liken your query to being in russia half a century ago and asking someone i understand who lenin is and trotsky i got too but whos this yokel stalin
political personal sexual anything at all against mitchell
one senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes
according to white house personnel hunt definitely works there as a consultant for colson but when i called the white house press office they said he hadnt worked there for three months then the pr guy said the weirdest thing to me  i am convinced that neither mr colson nor anyone else at the white house had any knowledge of or participation in this deplorable incident at the democratic national committee
absolutely
no it was closer to seven hundred thousand
suck mebeautiful
you need some work buddy
finch you can be the one to date a nearlydead insane chick  eat your damn imitation hot dog
finch  where were you last night what happened to the foolproof plan
mister finch  are you trying to seduce me

you know hes got a point  were fucking americans  we stick out like sore thumbs
lets try to be precise then the word torture does not appear in our orders we have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies as for the nlf they request that their members in the event of capture should maintain silence for twentyfour hours and then they may talk thus the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished  what type of interrogation should we choose  the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months
sid ahmed
with the others they are trying to stop the people
lets try 
no theyll do even more weve given them the opportunity to do a lot more  do you understand what i mean starting tomorrow they wont be groping in the dark any more every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy a selfconfessed criminal  and they will be able to pass to the offensive have you thought of this
why
rue de thbes in the upper casbah i think 
good evening sir
why yes of course  but for the moment lets be satisfied with algiers in the mountains our work is always easier
she says that ali is still in the casbah
it couldve happened to anyone
so what good is it to us if its been erased
right now  guess whos been buying coke from him for the last five and half years
she kills the old man and makes it look like miss lawson did it  pretty slick
for starters id like to know why she left the house and didnt report the death
did i say it was a natural death
a massive cardiac arrest
we found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood
i dont think so  the membrane in his nasal passage didnt show any sign of long time usage
yes
did miss lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving
she planned this  she wanted us to find the nasal spray
the mes report stated that marshs nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use  without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning  we would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her
were going all the way on this one frank  tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two  fifteen to twenty five
i was just about to make my point your honor
im just curious to see if mr troxell reconstructed anything else
your honor im trying to establish the sense of betrayal miss lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was
your honor im trying to establish a pattern in dr paleys behavior with women
i have
no
yes
yes
no  she stopped by to pick up some papers
about a year and half ago
for about one year
what did she say
she said she was going to fuck me like ive never been fucked before
well  i realized that she wasnt interested in me  she was just trying to get information out of me
no
thats enough
no
chinese peony root
i tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water
no
then  those are not your own words
im a nurse  i used to work at roseburg memorial hospital  dr paleys on staff there
we dated for about a month last year
he used to call me  tell me that i couldnt just walk out on him  he said that if i didnt come back hed make my life miserable
while i was seeing dr paley i mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary   three days after i spoke to him in his office he went to the head nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs
what other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial
so isnt it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love  that what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didnt stop it was going to kill him  that if she did leave his heart couldnt take it
well think about it  isnt it possible
you dont like her because you were involved with mr marsh before she came along  isnt that true
yes
yes
well  im a little confused  this is a charge receipt from rosens drug store where mr marsh had an account  its dated the day of the murder  is this your signature
am  or pm
i dont know if its something i can explain to you
sure  where to
because im your attorney  i shouldnt be going to your house
oh  well theyre different
great  ill see you at the office at nine
andrew loved this old cabin  he always dreamed about moving to tahiti  living in a hut and becoming a beachbum  i could never imagine myself doing that  but somehow when he talked about it he made it sound so alive   so wonderful  soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets  leaving the world and its problems behind  i wish hed had a chance to do it
what
i dont use cocaine anymore  if she says she saw me doing it shes lying
i went out on the boat
im glad you have such confidence in me
what does that mean  youve been thinking about the case  or you thought everything out before you killed marsh
are you scared
fuck him  he tried to shatter mine
i do need you  no matter what you think of me  i didnt do it
im not leaving without that tape
i love you too dad

well what am i supposed to think
sshhh after going through the safety deposit box im sure youll find youre way to this letter its hard to write this to my own children i could let this die with the rest of me i suppose  but as one gets older one fears subside what becomes more and more important is to be known  known for all that you were during this brief stay row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were its easy for a mother to love her children no matter what  its something that just happens i dont know if its as simple for children youre all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong but i thought it was important to give you that chance to give you the opportunity to love me for all that i was
you mean  she didnt like sex

why
hes a genius theyre not photographs  theyre stories entire histories captured in moments
youre right you know we dont have much time
what
well what is this
yes absolutely you have this habit of not needing and that its hard to break i understand  of course in that case why sleep  you dont need rest or for that matter eat you dont need food
i know you what can this possibly mean to anyone who doesnt need meaning   who goes with the mystery  who pretends he isnt scared to death
what does that have to do with it
for who
then he can move people move
francesca listen to me you think whats happened to us happens to just anybody what we feel for each other how much we feel were not even two separate people anymore some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone  most people dont even think it exists and youre going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do that staying here alone in a marriage alone in a town you hate in a house you dont feel apart of anymore  youre telling me thats the right thing to do
but now that you have it

if there is one thing i cant stand about sleeping with women its all the fucking mind reading
mickey
how much money
is that what you think
does the case lock
like each other  they hate each other
it started way before i was around i think basically its because he thinks johnnie is a complete idiot but johnnie runs chicago because gino is his father
yeah twice
not much really  caesar was nervous kept cleaning the apartment  the first time he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear
gino doesnt know english or at least he pretends he doesnt so he doesnt talk much  he gets right to the point  both times they talked for about five minutes had one drink and then they left
he wont
if he runs everyone will assume he took the money
thats okay as long as he believes it was johnnie
im still here
you dont quit on me violet and i wont quit on you
dont be sorry  help me
hey johnnie 
caesar  what the fuck time is it
im assuming were exploring that possibility

are you sleeping with her come come mr gittes you dont have to think about that to remember do you
mr gittes  youre dealing with a disturbed woman whos lost her husband i dont want her taken advantage of sit down
you didnt see mulwray much did you
well it was about five days ago you were outside the pig n whistle and you had one hell of an argument
well be in touch mr cross
thats where life begins marshes sloughs tidepools he was fascinated by them  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs youd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty he made this city
the future mr gittes the future now wheres the girl i want the only daughter i have left as you found out evelyn was lost to me a long time ago
have you got your checkbook handy mr cross ive got the girl
what can i tell you kid youre right when youre right youre right and youre right
oh they dont
you bet your ass you dont you cant even pay me off
call me jake how is everything
could you drive me somewhere
sue the shit out of em
how are you lou
no
i heard it was an accident
you accusing me of extortion
well i hope she wasnt too much of a disappointment to you lou
shut up  go on
gee lou im doing the best i can
jake youre very disturbed youre crazy thats her father
yes
what do you mean
suppose they did how does it concern you
a check
mr gittes  dont tell me how i feel
but he wasnt killed
why
did you have affairs
did he know
i dont see anyone for very long mr gittes  its difficult for me now i think you know all you need to about me i didnt want publicity i didnt want to go into any of this then or now is this all
that your maiden name
been meaning to talk to you about that
money how they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs that i dont know
yes he never forgave him for it
the valley
no i think id remember
what what is it
actually this hasnt happened to me in some time
why
the district attorney gives his men advice like that
i thought i was keeping someone from being hurt and actually i ended up making sure they were hurt
theres something black in the green part of your eye
you didnt tell me
including the death of your husband
the police
shes not tied up
you mean she just found out
like she knows about hollis death like she knows more than you want her to tell
no
shes my sister and my daughter
so thats why you hate him
where can we go
its on your desk say you hear the one about the guy who goes to the north pole with admiral byrd looking for penguins
jesus thats in chinatown aint it
well i never expected anything to happen like what happened to mr mulwray the point is if it ever comes out i want somebody to know i didnt know what would happen
oh no
a miss sessions calling
ida sessions
jj gittes and its not a departmental matter
help yourself
hope so hes working for us
yeah must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances
only when i breathe
neither do i actually but you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me
si
when it comes whatd you tell him
nothin morty its my lunch hour i thought id drop by and see who died lately
yeah
thats swell but how about here  ever worked for robert knox emma dill clarence speer marian parsons or jasper lamar crabb
yeah
yes
all she needed for that was the phone book
yeah whats wrong with you guys think ahead we find em sue em well make a killing  well have dinner at chasens twice a week well be pissing on ice the rest of our lives
whyd she run away
we missed the best of it didnt we pal
come in alfredo
ok ok but now that ive got a job i11 probably stop going
why what do you mean
its people in the slaughterhouse killing a calf theres blood all over the floor like a lake and through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die
but why there must be some way to make her understand
no and nobody knows where she is
yeahgetting theres downhill and all the saints help you but coming back the saints stand there watching you thats all gods will be done
i know but take themiracle of the loaves and fishes for example i think about it a lothow is it possible for
the army says that as a war orphan i dont have to serve in the military but nothing can be done its a bureaucratic error i have to leave day after tomorrow morning theyre sending me to rome but theyll discharge me ten days later lets go
good this way we can finally talk ill convince him this time
nor have i even though you disappeared  but whats the point of talking about it we risk being pathetic and ridiculous  you still live in rome
he wasnt crazy in the beginning i was upset i think i really hated him but then with time i understood what he saidand your silence too
ill never agree with you never elena
no
and i never asked for one you have nothing to explain i always thought that what you did was right and that was that with no beating around the bush  only one thing made me suffer bolting the door shut before going to bed at night
so whats that got to do with it
well its hard to call an important person by his first name but if it really matters to you i11 call you  toto
i promise not to bring any more venuses and not to worry  and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers 
sit down everybody  for heavens sake
we certainly do  vacations over  starting right after dinner  but right now  that lady over there    thats the new society editor i take it  you think i could interrupt her a moment mr bernstein
well well  isnt that nice
you know why  she was so 
i guess mr kane didnt think so well of susies art anyway
yes 
nothing particular the matter with him they tell me  just  
that looks pretty nice
september the ninth
go and get yourself washed up mr bernstein  there doesnt seem to be an serious injury
im going to live right here  as long as i have to
because were running a newspaper mr kane not a scandal sheet
there is no news big enough
its not our function to report the gossip of housewives  if we were interested in that kind of thing mr kane we could fill the paper twice over daily 
thatll be all today mr carter youve been most understanding good day mr carter
thank you  i cant imagine how mrs kane came to make such a silly mistake  the sedative dr wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle   i suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her
there are no objections to my staying here with her are there
of course
charles  your  your breaking this mans neck   would scarcely explain this note   serious consequences for mr kane   for myself and for my son  what does this note mean miss 
maybe i should have  the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was
charles
it may not be about anything at all
i insist on being told exactly what you have in mind
i dont think so  are you coming charles
too late for what  too late for you and this   this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me  well you wont do it i tell you  you wont do it
rogers i dont think i will postpone doing something about you until im elected  to start with ill break your neck
whats the matter with you
if these sidewalks were kept in condition  instead of the money going to some cheap grafter 
im sorry  they live here too
oh me 
pretty old  ill be twentytwo in august
i was referring to myself  i thought we might have a picnic tomorrow  it might be a nice change after the wild west party tonight  invite everybody to go to the everglades 
we can discuss all this some other time susan  right now 
 and left  of course theyll hear  im not saying goodbye  except to you  but i never imagined that people wouldnt know
in case you dont know emily this  this gentleman   is 
thanks
your job isnt to give mrs kane your opinion of her talents youre supposed to train her voice nothing more
i dont know how to run a newspaper mr thatcher  i just try everything i can think of
yes sir 
cant say sir
its been a tough day
its a good idea for a newspaper  four hundred sixy thousand
our readers are anyway i dont know about the rest of the country
charlie 
look out that window
what lesson  not to expose fraud when i see it  not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property  run it the way i said reilly  this afternoon a great man was assassinated 
ive got to think of emily 
thats just a little promotion scheme nobody expects you   mike will you try and get mr leland some coffee
shes going to leave you 
yes
i couldnt possibly live on as little as that charlie  well let the salary stay where it is
rogers isnt even pretending  he isnt just scared anymore  hes sick  frank norris told me last night he hasnt known rogers to be that worried in twentyfive years
if i want to i can go to court a father has a right to 
it is  go on mr thatcher 
you wont be lonely charles
thats what you think is it jim
its a letter from her lawyers
that must have been love
sure
theres a part of a scotch castle over there but we havent bothered to unwrap it
millions  if anybody wants it
oh i dont know  theyll clear all right
id rather you just talked  anything that comes into your mind  about yourself and mr kane
what did you get
the last ten years have been tough on a lot of people
am i sure
what the hell is that

goddamnit they are out there david 
david 
what  why
maybe they are  maybe this is all part of the package  the building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale  maybe requiring us to come together in this way was in effect part of the plan
this seemed best
thank you
it could be anything  the first volume of some encyclopedia galactica
analyzing signal polarization shifts
maybe itll be at the end of the data when the message recycles
in fact by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible
is it possible  yes  but 
but what do i say
thats my scientist
am i artifact or dream  you might ask that about anything
you have your mothers hands  there are no tests ellie  we dont sit in judgment  think of us more as librarians  curators of the universes rarest and most valuable creation
if we dont engineer a consistent causality itll work itself out on its own and thats almost always worse  ellie according to your physics none of this is possible  a lot of it youre simply not capable of understanding not yet  no offense
but you said you wanted to help  dont you see what it would mean
please  if you downloaded everything about us you know the problems we face the impact it could have  it could make the difference 
once upon a time i was a hell of an engineer  please sit doctor  i have guests so rarely its important to me they feel welcome in my home  did you know this was once yeltsins flying dascha  that dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot  at least thats what the people who sold me the plane said

very smooth  its palmer right where i came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards  really though the bible describes a god who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old  i look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies each with hundreds of billions of stars i mean burn me for a heretic but your god seems awfully small
i dont consider you the enemy ellie  im not out to get technology  i only ask the question  does it have to have all the answers  i look out there and i see so much emptiness people are so starved for meaning and its something they just dont seem to be getting from science
its getting late
thank you
 i dont know 
it also makes god enormous  i think of the scope of your universe ellie and it takes my breath away  as it will everyone elses
maybe what you experienced cant be reduced to images on a videotape maybe they still plan to grant your request only in their own way in their own time or maybe its just like you said  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology
what is it
but 
recommendations
it wasnt his fault nobody said anything about seats we

i thought id listen to some of the tapes see whats so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe
li mu bai is coming to stay the night
i didnt have the heart
wait  im a friend
why were you spying on the yus
this jade fox is a woman
then leave her to me
ive always wanted a disciple worthy of wudans secrets
whats it to you
im just playing around
shut up
autumn is coming  ill shut the windows for you
beautiful but dangerous  once you see it tainted with blood its beauty is hard to admire  its 400 years old
my friend li mu bai  hes given it to sir te as a gift
writers wouldnt sell many books if they told how it really is
sure  no place to bathe for days sleeping in fleainfested beds they tell you all about that in those books
his name was meng si zhao  he was a brother to li mu bai by oath one day while in battle he was killed by the sword of li mu bais enemy  after li mu bai and i went through a lot together  our feelings for each other grew stronger  but how could we dishonor mengs memory  so the freedom you talk about i too desire it  but i have never tasted it
yes from the west  he went undercover and and followed her here
im just borrowing some clean clothes  im not staying
how dare you accuse us  i always knew you had stolen the sword ive done nothing but protect you and your family  and youre repaid me with nothing but contempt  li mu bai himself spared you and all you do is insult him  we wanted some peace and youve ruined it all youre no sister of mine
with all the traffic on your rooftop these days it took me a while to get in here  i cant wait any longer  i was wrong to let you go  come back with me  youll be happy in the desert  youll be free there
give it back
you coward
it has  hows business
fine
yes
perhaps i could ask you to deliver something to sir te for me
but something is going on at the yu household
be careful  sir te requires discretion  official business is difficult enough  dont let personal feelings make it worse and i dont know even this poster could be some sort of trap
thats not what i meant  i dont care about the sword
my job was to get the sword back without embarassing anyone  i wasnt about to ruin her life or her fathers
shes an aristocrats daughter shes not one of us  in any case it will all be over soon  youll kill fox and shell marry
i wish there were something more i could do to help you
my life is departing  ive only one breath left
ive already wasted my whole life i want to tell you with my last breath i have always loved you i would rather be a ghost drifting by your side as a condemned soul than enter heaven without you  because of your love i will never be a lonely spirit
thats good  sometimes the help cant keep their hands to themselves its very embarassing
father
what does it say
then someones trying to set him up we should inform li mu bai
care for a hot dog
this is special darlin  please
i knew that
i saw it too
the venom of bad memories  you were there you saw her  i saw you seeing her
my pleasure eric dont smoke these
how bout the morgue
this isnt your place  this isnt your fight  and i dont need your help
fun hes not going away hes scaring the piss outta me
i dabble  may i

another jolly nickname
youre too late  there was a guy outside  on the stairs  you really need to talk to  but he turned to dust and blew away  i dont have any power for you to take
im already alone
very well its your ass
18k  crap
this is a cobra mr grange  yes it is real
i intend no slight to you but i cannot find the english to adequately express just what he is  i suppose western mythology would describe him as a fury
one of mine  and it wasnt a standard hit
our crow
i dont think so
thats right
ill be fine
look i know this sounds corny but whenever i feel like i cant go on i  turn to jesus and he helps me through the problem call me an anachronism but 
excuse me
sebastian was a pathological liar i wouldnt believe a word he 
you didnt show it to anybody
really i thought he said it all the time
not a whole lot we take some classes together hes got a bad rep but its mostly bullshit
take yourself youve slept with several women are you happier because of it
alright i said i was sorry  can we start over again i think weve gotten off on the wrong foot
thats a matter of opinion
is that the last thing you need my your clever
refreshing
no its okay i mean i look at you with all your morals and values and well you seem to be happy in your choices i envy you no bullshit
give it up
ouch do you think we could spend some time together this morning
well i was just calling to see how youre doing
what are you doing
of human bondage
you volunteer i dont think so
it was perfect
hi
i was thanking her vietnamese is such a beautiful language
thanks  nice meeting you
ah duh boys ive never even gone to first base with a guy what do i do
it was nothing
maybe you should try it on your friend ronald sometime
well not exactly
i want to go home
i swear
is it me
im taking a shower
no
good night cecile
i know
let me tell you something doctor chicks love a guy with a bad rap they say they dont but they dont mean it they all think that theyre the ones that are going to save me the trick is to let them think its true
well you dont have to get nasty about it
what nervous im going to win
would you cut the psycho babble bullshit mom theres pictures of me on the internet
i told you to lock the door
and you think she bought it
who is this
alright shes staying with some friends of her parents the osheas she caught the train twenty minutes ago into grand central
but i cant even see her she doesnt have her own phone i dont even know her email address
no
its sebastian hes out of his mind
hopefully though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid
in any event my feelings were hurt when i learned that he had fallen for someone else someone chaste pure innocent
why go through cecile why not just attack court
oh come on kathryn its too easy but i thought high school was only four years i mean please she knows nothing shes seen nothing i could have her under the table at au bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it i have a reputation to uphold
that was just simple revenge what i have planned requires sheer genius
shut up and turn to page 64
what makes you think id go for that bet thats a seventy thousand dollar car
okay
thank you mmmm that feels good
eat me sebastian its alright for you to fuck everyone but because im a girl its wrong well let me tell you something i didnt ask to be a girl do you think i relish the fact that i have to act like mary sunshine twenty four seven so i can be considered a laaaady do you think i take great delight when i hear  kathryn is so wonderful kathryn is a model child kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day  im the marsha fucking brady of the upper east side and sometimes i want to kill myself for it no i dont enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer so theres your psychoanalysis doctor freud now are you in or are you out
yippy
yeah
whats your problem
morning
oh yes
it was fantastic
it was it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part
whats wrong with you why are you acting this way
then do me a favor and get rid of her if not for me then do it for you look at yourself youre a joke shes turned you into jelly what do you want to be one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling people used to respect you they feared you and now youre going to throw that all away
not that its any of your business but yes
will you calm down
get out
ill do my best
oh please i cant have you do that
whatever you are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and i mean never to see my daughter again is that understood
do you know where she is
yes you already did
excuse me
how will i get to her
it seems that you and i have some talking to do
hello i just met amy and she pointed out where you live
what do you mean
i can make wishes like this come true  ill be just like daddy wants me to be  play with the other children  not sit around by myself  tell the truth 
i wasnt saying anything i was singing
the song i was trying to hum the song my friend taught me
sometimes
thats why i can tell you straight out you think too much about irena  blame yourself for her death  and its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about amy
yes darling
times have changed
i thought amy was calling i guess not
what
well you know where it is
is that where she got the ring mrs reed she shouldnt be up there
yes daddy
yes i did
yes daddy
i wanted to talk to you  i wanted to tell you about the other children
it was on account of the birthday party
they ran away
yes amy
but
no
ive wanted a friend too ive been lonely
i can not tell you
whenever you want
the numbers simply dont mean anything
this is more fun than just pretend
its a warm breath  warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deers back in the hot summer sweet with leaves and mosses
oh it is it is deaths terrible
thats a finelooking ring
most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl
i wouldnt be surprised if it were a true wishing ring
maybe if its a real mourning ring like we have in jamaica all you got to do is turn it on your finger close your eyes and make a wish
but i saw what it was its the little deer
do you know the story of the headless horseman
why hasnt he got a head
wait a minute listen
well that seems a harmless fancy 
well see that she gets there in good time
she needed a companion so out of her own hunger she created one in her mind her friend was in the garden in her mind her friend never leaves her right this very minute im sure shes upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind

there was this kid that i grew up with he was a couple years younger than me and sort of looked up to me you know  we did our first work together worked our way out of the street  things were good and we made the most of it  during prohibition we ran molasses up to canada and made a fortune your father too  i guess as much as anyone i loved him and trusted him later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stopover for gis on the way to the west coast that kids name was moe greene and the city he invented was las vegas this was a great man a man with vision and guts and there isnt even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town  someone put a bullet through his eye no one knows who gave the order  when i heard about it i wasnt angry  i knew moe i knew he was headstrong and talking loud and saying stupid things  so when he turned up dead i let it go and said to myself this is the business weve chosen i never asked who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business
very impressive
how is his health
hes very kind tell him its appreciated  im sure it will be profitable all the way around
that is a complete falsehood
i do not
i do not
clemenza promised rosato three territories in the bronx after he died and then you took over and welched

an integer
cmon that guy was a fuckin piece of work
will this is sean maguire sean will hunting
the least you can do is show me a little appreciation

we havent really gotten into it lambeau maybe you should my phones been ringing off the hook with job offers
now wait a minute gerry
gerry
he is at a fragile point hes got problems
why is he hiding why is he a janitor why doesnt he trust anybody because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most
and why does he hang out with his friends because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to its called loyalty
thats it thats why i dont come to the goddamn reunions becaue i cant stand the look in your eye when you see me you think im a failure i know who i am im proud of who i am and all of you you think im some kind of pity case you with your sycophant students following you around and you goddamn medal

you were right  and i was wrong there  did you ever think youd hear me say that  spectacularly wrong instead of observing those animals i tried to control them  i squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives  not their lives as man would have them behind electric fences but in the wild  behavior in their natural habitat the impossible dream of any paleontologist  i could have had it but i let it slip away  thank god for site b
isla nublar was just a showroom ian something for the tourists site b was the factory floor  we built it first on isla sorna eightsome miles from nublar

its called selftesting  but in your case it sounds more like selfdestruction  a uniquely human characteristic  in fact human beings destroy things so well that i sometimes think thats our function maybe every few sons some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world clears the decks and lets evolution proceed to his next phase  maybe death and destruction are our job maybe were supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that

excellent
turn it off lex  turn it off
do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninetyeight percent in the last ten years

i suspected that he  well
that he was  satisfied in that regard  i didnt want to pry
two or three months thats all   i seduced him
theyre ubiquitous  what we try to do  is make them a little less so
ive hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from
he was murdered
why were you given notice
it couldnt be for that incident with burgel the other day
now youve fallen into his trap when he goes to bed at night burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him
ive heard of it happening
first these nameless authorities were the root of all evil now its insignificant burgel  if indeed there was a mistake  and a minor one at that  youre suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all
i knew you walked this way to work  i wanted to find you before they did

unknown unidentified and unwanted and theres more every day man theres more everyday

unless he was involved with grunemanns disappearance
inspector we understand your position ours is a little different we have an investment in tom grunemann the company has an investment and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves
mr streiger speaking frankly  weve appreciated the sergeants interest you know all along here locally but new york thats  well

on earth

cmon theres not much difference
cmon billy  im trying to work for gods sake
tough shit  youre stuck with me
you mean for good

why does he decide
like a principal
i dont understand daddy
overruled  the witness will answer please
mr kramer isnt it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago
i do not your honor however
the first couple yes but after that it became increasingly difficult
yes  i tried to talk to ted my exhusbandabout it but he wouldnt listen  he refuses to discuss it in any serious way i remember one time he said i probably couldnt get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby sitter for billy
your honor i would like to place in evidence a report on mrs kramers therapy by her therapist dr elinore freedman of la jolla california
yes
look you dont understand  i need a job  ive got a kid and
call up the people at j walter thompson  set up an appointment at four
how many lovers have you had permanently
do you have a lover now
i suppose
oh  what do you call it then a success  the marriage ended in divorce
congratulations mrs kramer you have just rewritten matrimonial law  you were both divorced mrs kramer

what
im going to take it
fine
i dont know johni mean to be brutally honest im not so sure what kind of mental shape joannas in right now  yknow she admitted she was seeing a shrink
do you want the kid or dont you
when joanna  my exwifewhen she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriagewell i guess most of what she said was probably true  there were a lot of things i didnt understand a lot of things i would do different if i could  just like i guess there are a lot of things joanna wishes she could changebut we cant  some things once they are done cant be undone  joanna says she loves billy  i believe she does  so do i  but the way it was explained to me thats not the issue  the only thing thats supposed to matter here is whats best for billywhen joanna said why shouldnt a woman have the same ambitions as a man i suppose shes right  but by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex  i guess ive had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent
charley my husband and i are divorced and kim thats our daughter is about billys age and the children play together a lot  so i guess we see each three or four times a week

i dont know  in a way im glad it all happened
no of course not but i think now that this has happened a lot of things can start to come out
like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic
well it shattered your faith in everything
claire
i found the pentacle
frustrating  form over content everythings so retro
what time did you make it for
on the day of the murders  what did the defendant request
this patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures
im aware of that but i dont think hes in any condition to make requests im trying to appeal to your morelogical self father  im concerned about harm to my patient
i think i should join you
he will  he has great faith
you know how i feel  the world is random  the only certainty i believe in is death
dont you get it  they had their 2000 years  now its our turn

yes  we won thats right
miette come here and relax
art sank sun set ark sank again
you need his bloodtype  like right away
whats his name
you just call
peter kelson
last week the catholic church certified him as genuinely possessed  you realize how rarely they make that ruling
townsend believed just as god became man in christ  so satan will assume human form  i believe it too
if youre possessed you cant reveal anything satan wants hidden  unless you trick him
if you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again
theres no reason why you should  this has been planned from your birth you fit all the criteria that we know of  never baptized born of incest devoid of faith
seven years  one baptism  hes your mothers only brother
sothen the coroners report is probably wrong  i meanthis is ridiculous  theres been a mistake  i dont believe any of this
what
that cant be right  my birthdays tomorrow
i see things  my worst fears  you need to know something peter  i was possessed once  like birdson  it took father lareaux six days to pull me out of it
maybe i should check lareauxs book its in the car  be right back  dont go anywhere
you have to be experienced to do this just wait outside otherwise you risk killing him
terrific
look john im facing it
i think its gonna be a waste of time
lemme guess  the lottery
its detective smythe
we millionaires yet
thanks for having me sally
no the less mystifying  good and evil are only illusions  there is no such thing as evil with a capital e  that suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings
there werent any voices
well we all have a degree of narcissism sally but a malignant narcissist is dangerously selfobsessed
hes looking right at me
ill quit maybe you should start
i dont know why i keep hoping youll grow out of this tomboy thing
his mother had a cookout a few weeks ago he could do a lot better if you ask me
what do you want me to tell you monica to go beat that girl up  to go have sex with him  im not going to do that yes i believe thinking of other people is important and yes id rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot  if that makes me too prissy for you too bad
youre the one always turning your nose up at me

hes threatened to do it its been building up in him for months
you said youd do anything athos anything to replace this king  so do it

well its brilliantly written but then everything you write is brilliant
it has no nobility

dont worry about that youll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work
its two of the letters in my favorite nurses name annie
you did great except theres just one little thingi cant work with this paper its corrasable bond it smudges maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white longgrained mimeo
i really value your criticism but maybe youre being a little hasty here
im telling you i cant
yeah yeah
have to wait
have to wait
it looks wonderful and so do you
you really think so
i think youre right
i dont know what youre talking about
im glad you like it

what if i pay the rent
not really  i triggered the alarm
oh bloody hell  youre a spy
of what
sean ambrose for one
youve either got it or you dont  let your conscience be your guide
you can be a thief and have a conscience
generally i dont favor coercing someone not when theres a chance my life could end up in their hands
can you think of a better one
look would it make you feel better if i didnt want you to do this
then feel better
very funnymaybe he has heard and doesnt want to know  maybe hes lost interest
oh i do  but as we know im a very poor judge of character
ethan you take care of yourself ill take care of myself because if push comes to shove im gonna bail  and without giving two week notice
just like old times
why  whats happened what did you see
no time to explain  youve done well and were so close  so close  its critical that you do whatever ambrose asks  dont worry  itll be over soon thats a promise come on now off you go
i wasnt thinking  justtrying to keep you from getting hurt thats all
dont be  wouldnt be on vacation if you did
twice
in any case youve got to recover chimera and bring it to us
 right  in fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts
you mean itll be difficult
do you  even assuming youre able to prevent ambrose selling chimera youve now got an additional problem  you destroyed all of chimera at biocyte  if ambrose is going to sell chimera now hell have to do it by taking a pint or so of miss halls blood to market
youd like me to conduct my own debriefing

well cover your escape
i dont think i was

they said you were drunk  why dont you tell her the truth
she needs me archie  she canna do without me she said it to my face  how can i stop now
yeah
of course
i said are you deaf as well as stupid
it is quite late enough
aye do
i came down at the queens request ill take my orders from her
you do not report for duty unless the queen requests it  you know that very well
i believe that decision rests with her majesty
i dont doubt that the queen was highly amused  she has always had a very healthy sense of humor
occasionally
quite
im fine
its nothing
im not married
why
im glad of it
archie
and i intend to be there when shes ready
craobhangeanmchnofhiadhaich
what does he know about the highlands
that doesnt make him an expert
what mr ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming  literary appreciation does not begin and end with tennyson
i hope they didnt go to any trouble john
ill decide when its exaggerated
yes maam
yes
the queen forbids it  i cannot allow it because i cannot live without you  without you i cannot find the strength to be who i must be  please
im breaking no promises
not at all dean  good of you to spare the time
youve seen the latest cartoon in punch i take it
so
not too protracted i hope
i made no request to go out riding today  how long has he been there
a few days maam
im very sorry maam  i cant imagine  he was certainly given no instructions
i have no idea
your majesty 
my family is quite capable of communicating with the queen in person
you ordered all members of the royal family to attend you at balmoral
yeah who isnt
its the games logic core  we actually patterned it after human brainwaves  i mean theres a personality in there thats what makes it so incredible
but he was playing the game  i mean you saw him
we are talking
greg never came home  a few hours is one thing nick but this is different somethings happened to him
alex i think youre freaking out gregs gone ill give you that  and maybe hes in trouble  but its not arcade thats doing it
quiet  i do have parents you know
call the others  laurie benz
no way
she thought benz was at school
my house  i want to try something
nick what is it
dantes inferno
one  in case
got it
the keys are supposed to be at the end of each level  once we get all the keys we can unlock arcades heart and then
yeah thats what worries me
what  theres nothing here
screamer
and then keep on driving
then well go home
that way
you have no time  what is your question
yesbuthow did you
thats impossible
it changes  there are eleven levels each one is a different layer of the arcade universe  the concept is youre entering the video game itself making your way across the circuit board to the logic core  arcades brain
i know but youre broke where are you
ill speak to someone
howdy to you
okay im thinking
have a good evening mr kesher
honey all the great ones came through here at one time or another
now i guess you and your aunt have an understanding so heres the key and you need anything just give a holler  everybody in this buildings pretty much okay with me or they wouldnt be here if you want later ill introduce you around no hard feelings if you dont and dont forget the rooftop garden its just up the stairs we passed its open to all the tenants you can see the hollywood sign from there
you got it see you later honey
its just for a night or two until she finds her own place i tried to explain that to aunt ruth but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up i kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didnt know any ritas 
so i guess your grandpa and grandma know her
his names wally brown  great guy been in the business since forever
i understand i saw the dress iim sorry   are you all right
are you okay
well then take a seat everyone betty why dont you join jimmy and well play the scene is there anything youd like to say bob something to betty before they begin
yeah  betty you dont rush it i dont rush it we play it close just like in the movies
yes there was
she sure is shes letting me stay here while shes working on a movie thats being made in canada but i guess you know that  i couldnt afford a place like this in a million years unless of course im discovered and become a movie star of course id rather be known as a great actress than a movie star but sometimes people end up being both and that is i guess youd say sort of why i came here im sorry im just so excited to be herei mean i just came here from iowa and now im in this dream place you can imagine how i feel
imim oh no i thought when i woke up i thought sleep would do it 
im not i dont know what my name is i dont know who i am
you dont remember anything else
you know what i wantits not that difficult
before what
then theyd put you in jail
im all right
what is it what do you see
well now weve got to figure that out first dont we
gotta keep an eye on her thats all
keep her from gettin in trouble thats all
nothing i dont like being out in the open like this
i just wanted to come here
unreal  so youre looking good whatcha doin these days
making ends meet huh

and all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts i dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that i revived and was an emperor ah me how sweet is love itself possessed when but loves shadows are so rich in joy news from verona how now balthasar dost thou not bring me letters from the priest how doth my lady is my father well how doth my lady juliet for nothing can be ill if she be well
o mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants herbs stones and their true qualities for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give nor aught so good but straind from that fair use revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse virtue itself turns vice being misaplied and vice sometimes by action dignified within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power for this being smelt with that part cheers each part being tasted slays all senses with the heart two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs grace and rude will and where the worser is predominant full soon the canker death eats up that plant
by and by i come  to cease thy strief and leave me to my grief tomorrow will i send
well then dear saint let lips do what hands do they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
sin from my lips o trespass sweetly urged give me my sin again
o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
i will not fail tis twenty year till then
mercutios soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company

signior romeo bon jour theres a french salutation to your french slop you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night

i probably do  but for the time being im willing to forget about it
you dont have to explain yourself to me deirdre
exactly  gregor he was the russians man  it was my people came up with the idea for this run but the russians who had the capital to finance it  gregor he was their insurance and i was ours everybody else was supposed to be neutral  gregor mustve got to swede
check this out  gregors a spook or he was one until recently  when he was a spy he lived the life  you know a prince in some eastern bloc country where nobody had shit and gregor had everything  then the wall goes down  no more cold war  and gregor is out of a job  no apartment no special stores with western food and video tapes  i would bet dollars against shit that gregor liked that phone and he doesnt want to give it up  and i wouldnt be surprised if hes arrogant enough to think
not likely  once yeah i was  but there wasnt an inch of profit in it and im a cash oriented girl if you take my meaning  im a hired gun same as the rest of you and thats all any of us needs to know about the other
i use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target  i trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through nice relaying that information to you

i wanted to see who you were
whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless
you need to know a lot of shit vincent
please help yourself  smoke as many youd like
i wont lie  there have been times when i had to do it times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didnt
my job vincent a job you dont need to know about  i cant go to the local cops  theyd never be able to get close enough at this point  its me or nobody and ive been on this job too goddamned long not to finish
this doesnt involve you dont you understand  i cant even guarantee you any money out of all this

its an international thing  several different peoples involved criminals from all over the world experts brought together to do a job  but maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the russian mob and the ira in bed together an unlikely group of partners

nobody touches her except me i touch her sheila told me you played bouncy bouncy with her
whos there
if junior thinks youre doing the bouncy bouncy with his sister hes gonna tap dance on your spleen 
its nothing just a slight business imbalance  hows glorias thumb
if it springs a leak itll be because buzz is making waves
i like the sport the way it is
how mr kastle
thats why mom ran away because you had to control everything
thats right sugar find the grip thats right for you then grasp firmly the camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a minigreen

thirty years ago  in residency  i passed out  you

you dont remember you did  but im sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get harry dont you  you remember that
you remember before you picked him up  when you looked up at the sphere you remember that  when the sphere opened  thats right  but you cant remember going inside can you  no of course not  harry couldnt either could he  like everythings on the tip of my tongue he said
is it
when you were in that sub  and that squid was attacking you  are you sure it was the squid that was attacking  do you know  i cant get beth on the radio  im in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean  all alone  surrounded by all this water was it really the squid that was attacking you norman  or was it something else  one of your fears  you never really saw what it was did you

you dont understand about the sphere
page 87 of what harry

oh so youre that dr johnson
youre a 53 year old shrink what are you gonna do

fear is their greatest weapon
not bad
what do you mean good morning do you mean that it is a good morning for you or do you wish me a good morning although it is obvious im not having one or do you find that mornings in general are good

you mean i generate an energy field
five maybe  let me handle it
hes bluffing
yes the force something horrible has happened  i couldnt see what it was or where it was but it was terrible terrible beyond description the cry of millions dying at once
all you have to do is lose your thinking self  dont focus on anything  let your body do your thinking you have to learn to act on what you feel not what you think  if i had the crystal it would be much easier  you could feel the force immediately but for now let yourself go  youll pick it up and someday youll have no need for that pistol either

appearances can be deceptive mrs de moraes
i have too much money to work mr lombard
now you are confusing me mrs de moraes
excuse me
couldnt nazi hunters do the job
the hotels are useful capital investments the kids liquid assets my guess is they own hotels across the globe and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot
have you got a pen
you you are out of order mr lombard i
i take it you learnt to live with yours then take it all the minddulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your wellbeing
leon hung himself
youyou spoke to him
you dont say
i didnt know my husband and friedman knew each other i just  do you think we spoke about it ive known for five years hes known ive known for five years but not once have we spoken about it there are things one just doesnt speak about
think what you like but dont presume to understand
why do i feel i neednt answer that
were turning in circles
here we go again
should i
i didnt intend it that way it just happened  he heard from laurence that youd been back  that wed argued he asked why and it just happened i told him everything i couldnt help it wanted to see him scared i had never seen him scared before you see
what are you doing you cant i
get to the point will you
can you tell me how you spell
a small loan would be welcome more urgently i need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me
well id sooner mug an old lady
lombard  it will take a few days for the things i need to get here meanwhile id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog
yeah goodnight emily
have you found your man is that where he is
a seminar in a baby breeding farm bodies in acid you think ill get anywhere with that jesus with luck i might raise a laugh they might even send a patrol car to check the place out whatever itll be too late
i see how much
what
on holiday
i dont know  this is just a delivery place man i swear i dont know where the kids are i work for martin thats all martin knows he works for friedman he knows
just me  martins gone back to the ambassador look
another hotel down the road martin lives there he took your money hes got a safe  i need a doctor
downstairs at the front jesus
no
la what
oh yeah better be good and hurry away then who knows we might be being watched maybe one of your stupid french companies has got a detective prying into your life  after all thats what they do to their employees isnt it huh hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives thanks for the lift
what are you up to eh savieer i mean not this but money passports a gun in a microwave who are you eh who are you
may i ask if you are jewish mr lombard
i hope its not too significant
well i would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning mrs spitz i wouldnt like to think id kept you waiting for nothing
okay recommended
i said earlier that my husband and i are supporting leonard in his photography mr lombard by this i mean that since his return from america i have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold so as you see i did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account
leonard does not hold a driving licence as for his passport i do not know where he keeps it
he could indeed mr lombard but had he done so i think he would have let us know about it
the proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about  his address is in this envelope with leonards address keys and other things you might need 
my rates
jah
is my money in there
no in hampstead why
youre making a mistake tough guy whoever he is your guys not one of friedmans
three oclock
how are you rhian
havent you then why the worried messages on his answering machine rhian id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble
good reasons
im afraid i dont understand
oh i she just moved ive got her new its in my book in the kitchen wait thank you
hed come prepared he had something besides shiva sleeping beauty the disney film  well it looked like the disney film it was something else i couldnt watch
yes three thousand pounds i still
 no in fact id seen him a couple of months earlier he was quite depressed his work wasnt getting anywhere he said he was going to try something new realism london in the nineties  documentary stuff you know
hows the boy doing
no
excuse me
small blond goodlooking she was with him when we met she had a funny english accent
fuckedup fucking weird
alors quoi
who  i dont know who the fuck youre talking about sunshine
figlio di puttana youre the french asshole who bumped off the london guys
what do you think huh
huh maybe he figured the news our london bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well he only shared his guilty secret last night and then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk
some guy called to let him know the frenchman whod called the night before he left london was in la looking to kill him he did his sums and decided to take the call seriously
two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the london hotels he didnt need your confession
salut laurent ouais it wasnt easy but i got what you wanted through interpol say whats your business with these spitzes
their last suspected kill occurred two years back though your spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group still id watch my step these people are wellconnected laurent former israeli prime minister etc the ladys also president of an international zionist organisation anyway you get the picture
thats a good idea sire
but not impossible gilles and la hire are ready to risk everything to save her
how dare you tell me what god tells me to do
theyve started the battle without me
jeanne youve been badly wounded
i promise
yes
jeanne no
you make it sound so simple
jeanne i believe in you more than anyone
did your voices tell you that  you told me you hadnt heard them for months
if god wants me to win he will find a way  and if he wants me to die if he wants me back then thats fine too  then ill be with him forever
not yet
i want to stay with you
im staying jean
im fed up with taking her orders she swore shed defeat the english before nightfall instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed  look at the mess were in  thats her mess not mine  were worse off then if shed never come at all   now do as i say and sound the retreat
good advice for the french not for the english  do you think god hates the english
no i said surrender in the name of the king of france
ah yes i forgot god sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission  do you think that god made the right decision to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of france
quite a few
 so you were in the middle of the battlefield with your sword in your hand waving it above your head charging against the enemy screaming and yelling fighting for your life and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone
oh yes my lady  all true kings of france must first be anointed in our great cathedral of rheims with the holy oil of clovis for it was within these very walls that saint remy received the sacred oil from heaven brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of king clovis
performing a miracle
so long as this bitch remains alive our armies refuse to fight  dont you understand  they want proof that god is on their side and the only way theyre going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch
your king  ah yes of course whats he going to pay me with cows  chickens  i prefer gold and the english have plenty  i wonder how much theyll pay to have the witch of orleans in their clutches those english are so arrogant they cant accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl it has to have been the devils work
and god who allowed you to be caught
no no im fine really
but where are you going to be
it seems that the english care more about you than the french
i dont know what youre going to ask me questions about  you may ask things that i wont want to answer
i will willingly swear to tell you what i am allowed to tell you but as to the rest even if you threaten to cut off my head i still wont tell you
last night
many things
yes
no i want to be confessed
and may i go to mass
you have nothing to regret
hes feeling wonderful
and your duke  the duke of bedford
wwwhat has that got to do with this maiden
i assure you charles the maiden has no greater admirer than myself but whatever our personal feelings we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war  for the sake of the kingdom it is imperative that you stop her going to compiegne
but her armys so small now
im im not the king
theres no time sire  we cant hold up the ceremony theres no telling when the english might come back theyre only ten leagues away
noooo
yes
go on to the next question
thats not a lot
i know but the english want her very badly and i have to tell you that they are proving much more generous
20000 gold crowns
you may have been with your counsel but ive been with mine and im telling you gods counsel is wiser than yours and hes telling me to speak to the english  now
jeanne you have to understand  its not easy for us  i mean for our pride  to suddenly be usurped by a  well with all due respect by a girl
i know what im doing so either lend a hand or go back to bed
xaintrailles  dont talk to me about miracles  if i was still sitting there waiting for a miracle id be dead now anyway
me too
yes  we can pray
of course i do  bring them up
no
no
why not  he has good teeth
thats different i mean we were fighting for a for a cause
here  take this instead
then lord dunois show me the way to the other side of the river
god knows but it was a bad idea
dont swear
won  such a small word will never do  this is victory jeanne this is glory
we still believe in you jeanne  if it were up to me id chase every goddamn englishman into the ocean but its not up to us anymore  its up to the king
five steeds and a few hackneys
playing
i am that i am  you dont like my face  maybe you prefer this one
nothing  im here to set you free
i might ask you the same question
i want to see that  do you mind if i stay on the side  i wont bother you
why not
but it didnt just get there by itself
i i was defending myself as best i could  everyone has the right to defend themselves dont they  or should i have let myself be killed
why are you doing this to me  do you get pleasure from hurting me
yes of course when you dont need me anymore
yes my lord
theres no sin in charity jeanne
jeanne  if we were to ask forgiveness all the time wed spend our whole life in church
well i try and talk to him but mostly hes the one who does the talking
he never says his name
why did she have to die
who wants me to stop
yes

nunheim
lucky thing for us they werent in that lime
rosebreen
you see hed been very clever everybody even our astute friend guild thought that wynant was alive and that he was the murderer but our hero had just one weak link in his chain  the telegrams wires and telephones were all very well  but no one had seen wynant so he picked on poor mimi here to strengthen his case  mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is  mimi who was it that told you to say youd seen wynant
well what
well thanks  well call you when we need you again
i dont think so  of course i was terribly upset  i hardly knew what i was doing
thats nothing  i saw him myself
theyll be here  dont worry  my men are picking them up
sit down  we didnt come here to watch you and that broad dance around a may pole  where were you the afternoon the girl was killed
how can i help but mind im constantly humiliated  just because i havent money
this is the first time ive seen him in years  i didnt want him to think i was highhatting him
dont worry  you wont see him again  what happened did you change your mind about going
do you realize that youre accusing me of 
hello   give me   well   
then someone was in with you  who was it  who was it  ill answer that   hello   hello 
so did we  i mean sherlock here
hello macaulay  come in
thats all right  what are you drinking
i havent been a detective for four years
my wifes father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things  and im looking after them
what about it tanner  isnt that the truth
what do you think
theyll want more than your word for that
last night  he came to see me at my apartment
do you mind putting that gun away my wife doesnt care but im in a delicate condition
this is your party
i had him out this morning
much better thanks
that last martini
take it easy
we need ice
i wonder if theyve   i dont want to hear anything about it
they were kidding you
tomorrow ill buy you a whole lot of detective stories
breakfast
all right shoot  i mean whats on your mind
someone get a doctor
you did
yes  i know all they know about the murder and im a great hero the tribune said i was shot twice
thats not true  he never came near my tabloids  thats one thing i always protect my tabloids
whos that
your guess is as good as mine
come on watson were going places
he went away lots of times when i knew him  but he never closed his shop ive got a hunch something is up
several things  hello fred  were hungry again yeah and lots of onions  oh and coffee
smart gal
hey hey  dont do that
i cant help it i cant tell a soul  i didnt even tell guild
oh theyll come  ill have guild issue the invitations 
yes
im afraid youre lying mimi you see i really did see wynant last night
after our hero had killed wynant he got a brilliant idea  he realized that he and julia could still collect money  wynant was supposed to be on a trip  no one knew where  so our dinner guest wrote letters to macaulay signing wynants name so that macaulay would continue to send the money to julia  he even telephoned macaulay   do you remember the first day that you came to see me he telephoned that he was in town
its the only way it makes sense
i had a key i worked here till they closed the shop
yes sir  julia wolf got me a job as bookkeeper
i know i left them there
oh yes  yes  thats right  
you did
yyes
baghdad
there you go jaeger  just find the buried treasure and youre a millionaire
deserters would have run they wouldnt have engaged
maybe thats all the iraqis could afford okay  maybe they got it on discount maybe the fuse is messed up  or maybe its going to go off in two seconds and we wont have to worry about getting jaeger down off there all well have to worry about is finding the pieces
what do you figure it to be
i dont know  theres a lot of space up here  they could be just about
so we wait
what am i supposed to do
its murder and i wont be any part of it
if i dont answer hell know somethings up
if i give it to you will you let us go
its like i said you dont really know lieutenant john epps very well do you
what are you doing
no youre not
i did it  i got the box open
wait  wait
christ  wes tell him  you know this stuff
we go we get rich we go home  its that easy
cool it jaeger  hey wes  wes
oh thats fun
weve got to do something  weve got to turn around
its the only way  we drive
im just thinking you know if the rest of the boys knew what were doing  i mean if they knew what we were coming back with
mine  land mine
were going to get off all right  well get you off of there  justbe cool
were going to be right over here
epps
it falls asleep and you die so wake it the hell up
dont let me die epps  i dont want to die
if we step on a mine well know it was let me see the maps
its the treasure thats what it is
what are they doing here
stay low
just stay down
were not going to do anything
if they land we can take them  if they dont land then weve got nothing to worry about
right now i wouldnt be surprised if eartha kitt showed up singing send in the clowns
so where do we start
weve been digging  weve been digging for hours  if there was anything here to find we would have found it
i feel air  probably opens up outside somewhere  thats where the light comes from  couldnt see it with the lanternon
i wouldnt know  i never imagined this not in my whole life did i ever imagine this
someones got to send the gold up  it cant get on the line by itself
it should or it will  least going back the way we came we know what were up against
well find our way  well
wes is dead
i dont want it this way  i wouldnt kill you just to kill you but i cant let you lose the gold for me  not when were so close
its a desert  thats what deserts do at night they get cold
no
the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here
couldnt be syria  we couldnt have gone that far north  its got to be saudi come on
well we should identify ourselves
ii never killed anyone before  i told you that
we cant stay here  even if that wasnt an iraqi soldier its only a matter of time before some show up  get all the water you can carry and well head out on foot
shiites i think
we go this way
what
hes going to slow down

that is called a crab apple switch its for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog now i dont know if i actually did what i did or got my life and story mixed in with other folks stories but i seem to recall that i had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home i was up in memphis working on the railroad like your daddy who had an easy job he would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track anyway i was coming down beale street and i heard this music coming from a saloon sure enough it was emory my daddy taught both of us to play but emory was natural at it got in a blues band and what not he and another boy had killed a boy named hocker sometime back and they balled the jack leaving town emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face bad luck i would say he got to drinking that corn liquor we went to his girls room and he wouldnt stop drinking he started talking about the old days and he went mad he pulled his knife and i got to mine first the lights went out
it is just a regular card

how did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon
like what
its an exaggeration of the truth maybe its based on something as simple as instinct like being able to touch someone and tell whether theyve done something wrong or the level of what theyve done wrong

barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field remember
lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system if the simulator isnt calibrated properly experiencing death in this level of vr is like experiencing death within a dream the experience becomes real

neither will the public  the media has caught wind of his pardon unless mr barnes starts giving me some tangible results im going to put him back in his cage
im what
he hearseverything
youresuch a wimp

which god would that be the one who created me or the one who created you  in your world the lord giveth and the lord taketh away but in my world the one who gave me life doesnt have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away
